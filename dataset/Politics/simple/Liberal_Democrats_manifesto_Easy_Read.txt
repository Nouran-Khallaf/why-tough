Making Britain better              
and fairer for everyone 
 
 
 
We are fighting to make life fair for 
everyone in Britain.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
We must change the way the country is run 
so we can fix the big problems that are 
happening at the moment.  
 
 
Like big problems with health, social care 
and the economy.  
 
 
 
 
More and more people are choosing the 
Liberal Democrats.    
 
 
They want us to end the terrible 
government that we have at the moment. 
 
 
They know that we will fight to make              
life better and fairer for them and                 
their communities. 
 
 
 
4 
Our plan for a stronger 
economy and more jobs 
 
 
The economy is about things like money, 
businesses and buying and selling things.  
 
It is about how this all works in Britain         
and the world.  
 
 
 
 
Many things cost too much at the moment. 
 
We will help people to afford the things       
they need.  
 
For example, we will make gas and 
electricity bills cheaper. 
 
 
And we will start a plan to make sure that 
everyone has enough healthy food to eat. 
 
 
 
 
 
We will also start a plan about how to   
make the economy stronger now and in        
the future. 
 
 
5 
This means things like: 
 
• Helping businesses to grow to get         
more money and jobs for the country.  
 
 
• Spending more on training and education 
to help people get good jobs and              
earn more money. 
 
 
• Saving our environment.  
The environment is the earth we live on, 
the countryside and the things around us.  
 
 
 
 
We will make sure that all people and 
businesses pay a fair amount of tax. 
 
 
That also means making tax fair for              
working families.  
 
 
Tax is money that people pay to the 
government to spend on things that the 
country needs. 
 
 
 
We will look after money for the country 
very carefully. 
 
This is to make sure the country has more 
money to spend and owes less money. 
 
6 
Our plan to save the 
environment  
 
 
We will make homes warmer and cheaper 
to heat. 
 
 
We will start a plan for the next 10 years         
to do that. 
 
 
 
 
We will make sure most electricity in the UK 
is made by the wind, sun and sea by 2030.  
 
 
That includes helping more people to          
make their own electricity by having              
solar panels on their homes. 
 
 
 
 
 
We will stop water companies from making           
our rivers and seas dirty and unsafe. 
 
 
 
 
 
We will keep plants, animals, seas and 
other things on earth safe. 
 
That includes planting at least 60 million 
trees each year to help the environment. 
 
7 
Our plan for better health     
and social care 
 
 
 
We will give everyone the right to see                   
a doctor within 7 days.  
 
Or 24 hours if it is urgent. 
 
 
 
 
 
We will make sure that everyone can see 
an NHS dentist if they need urgent care          
for their teeth. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We will help more people to get mental 
health care sooner. 
 
 
People may need mental health care if they 
feel very sad or worried a lot. 
 
 
 
 
 
We will help more people to live longer        
if they have cancer. 
 
 
8 
We will fix big problems with social care. 
 
Social care is support that people may need 
to look after themselves or do important 
things. 
 
 
 
 
We will give people free personal care.  
Personal care is support to do things like 
getting washed and dressed. 
 
 
 
 
 
We will work with other political parties           
to make a plan about better social care. 
 
 
 
 
We will make sure that care workers           
are paid more money. 
 
 
This will help to get more care workers         
as there are not enough at the moment. 
 
 
 
 
We will give people who care for family or 
friends more money from the government. 
 
And time off that they are paid for. 
 
9 
Our plan for better education 
and better support for 
children and families   
 
 
We will make sure there is mental health 
support for children in every school. 
 
 
 
 
 
We will spend more money on schools and 
colleges. 
 
And we will fix big problems with school     
and college buildings that need repairs. 
 
 
 
 
 
We will spend more on good education          
for very young children. 
 
 
 
We will give free school meals to all 
children who are poor. 
 
 
 
 
We will give every adult £5,000 to spend on 
education and training so they can learn 
new skills all through their lives. 
 
10 
Our plan for pensions and 
stopping people being poor  
 
 
We will work to stop people being            
very poor within the next 10 years. 
 
 
 
We will change unfair rules about benefits 
that are making people poor. 
 
 
Benefits is extra money that some people 
who need it can get from the government. 
 
 
 
 
For example, we will change rules that 
mean people can only get some benefits  
for their first 2 children.  
 
 
This is making many families with more 
children poor. 
 
 
 
 
We will give older people enough                
extra money every year for their 
government pension. 
 
 
11 
Our plan for keeping people 
safe from crime  
 
 
We will make sure there are more             
police officers working in the community.  
 
 
 
We will also make sure that: 
 
 
• The police look into all crimes where 
people steal things from other people's 
homes. This is called burglary. 
 
 
 
 
• People do not have to wait too long            
for crimes to go to court. 
 
 
 
 
• There are local services to support        
young people when they need it to help 
them stay away from violence. 
 
 
 
 
• Women and girls get better support                 
if someone is violent to them. 
 
12 
Our plan for better housing 
and communities 
 
 
We will build many new homes every year 
across the UK.  
 
We will build 380,000 homes a year.  
 
That includes 150,000 social homes           
that are cheaper to live in. 
 
 
 
 
We will make life fairer for people who        
rent homes. 
 
For example, by making sure they cannot 
be told to leave without a good reason. 
 
 
 
We will also: 
• Stop people from having to sleep on          
the streets. And stop this being a crime. 
 
• Make sure that every home and business 
can get broadband internet. 
 
• Do more to stop Jewish and Muslim 
people being hurt or treated badly just 
because they are Jewish or Muslim. 
 
 
13 
Our plan for better transport 
 
We will make it cheaper and easier for 
people to have cars that run on electricity.  
 
They are better for the environment than 
cars that use petrol. 
 
 
 
We will make public transport better by: 
 
• Keeping train fares the same as now.  
 
 
• Making tickets for public transport          
easier to use. 
 
 
• Having more trains that run on electricity.  
 
 
• Making train stations better. And making 
them easier for disabled people to use. 
 
 
 
• Helping to get better bus services for 
local areas. 
 
 
 
We will also make new paths for people          
to walk or go by bike. 
 
14 
Our plan for culture, media 
and sport  
 
 
We will keep the BBC and Channel 4          
safe from changes that could harm them. 
 
 
 
We will help more people to take part in 
sports and exercise. 
 
 
 
Our plan for people who 
come to Britain to work, 
study or be safe  
 
 
We will have fair and clear rules for         
people who move to the UK to work. 
 
 
Some people come to Britain to be safe 
from war, violence and other problems. 
We will make better and quicker decisions 
about who can stay. 
And we will give people the right to work                
3 months after they ask to stay. 
We will stop the unfair law that means 
some people who try to come here              
could be sent to Rwanda in Africa. 
 
15 
Our plan for human rights 
and making Britain fair             
for everyone  
 
Human rights are rights that we all have. 
They help to keep us safe. 
 
 
We will stand up for everyone's human 
rights whoever they are.  
 
 
We will also start a plan to make sure that 
people of all races are treated fairly. 
 
 
 
 
We will work to keep important                
human rights laws in the UK. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
We will start better ways to deal with some 
crimes that happen to women and girls. 
 
 
 
 
 
We will make it easier for disabled people 
to work and take part in the community. 
 
16 
Our plan for better voting  
and politics 
 
 
 
We will change the way we vote to           
make it fairer.  
 
 
This means starting a new way to vote  
called proportional representation. 
 
 
 
It also means making sure that people can          
still vote without a photo document to show 
who they are. 
 
 
 
 
We will give more power to local areas           
in Britain.  
 
 
This will give people in local areas more 
say in important decisions. 
 
 
 
 
 
We will work to keep Scotland part of the 
United Kingdom. 
 
 
 
 
17 
Our plan for a safer and  
fairer world 
 
 
We will keep our support for NATO. This is 
a group of countries that help each other         
to keep safe. 
 
 
 
 
We will spend more money on our army 
and keeping our country safe. 
 
 
That includes more support for people in 
our army, navy and air force while they are 
keeping our country safe and after they 
leave. 
 
 
 
 
We will go back to spending the same 
money as before to help poorer countries. 
At the moment this money has been cut. 
 
 
 
 
We will fix the problems in our relationship 
with Europe.  
 
 
 
We will stand up for the people in Ukraine 
and give them the support they need.
