Strong leadership
We promise to
•
make good decisions, solve problems 
and make good changes 
•
work with other people who help run the 
North of Ireland and work on issues that 
affect the island of Ireland.
We will keep leading and working 
together to bring positive change for all.
We have stood up to the Conservative 
Party when they have made bad decisions.
We have protected you from their worst 
decisions. 
For example
•
Brexit - when the North of Ireland was 
taken out of a  group of countries called 
the European Union.  This group work 
together to make laws, buy and sells 
things in an easy way and help each 
other.
•
Austerity - when the government spent 
less money on public services.
Standing up for you

The economy is the buying and selling of

children with special needs.
Leadership on Economy

Infrastructure is the important things that 
help our towns and cities work well.  
For example, roads, bridges, and buildings.
We want to make sure important projects 
happen.
For example
•
make Magee University have more 
students.
•
building and making better roads 
✓from Derry to Aughnacloy
✓from Belfast to Derry
•
building a new Casement Park stadium 
to make it better
•
build a bridge between Warrenpoint and 
Carlingford.
•
the Ulster Canal project that will reopen 
an old canal between the North and 
South of Ireland. 
Leadership on Infrastructure
Public services are things the government 
spends money on for everyone to use. 
For example, schools and healthcare.
We want to fight for a fair way to fund 
public services in the North of Ireland.

We want to 
•
meet climate change goals to slow down 
global warming and look after our planet
•
move fairly to net zero to make sure the 
amount of harmful gases we put into the 
environment is the same as the amount 
we take out

look after the environment 
•
find solutions to environmental problems 
in and around Lough Neagh.
Leadership on the Environment

Making good changes happen
Sinn Féin works as part of a team across 
the Island of Ireland.
We are the only party that can make good 
changes happen across all of Island.
We will keep focusing on the needs of our 
people and communities. 
Sinn Féin stands up for workers, families, 
and communities. 
We make sure people have their voices 
heard. 
We think people want decisions about their 
lives and futures made by people they have 
voted for.
British politics have caused problems for 
the North of Ireland.
For example
•
Brexit
•
cuts to government spending and 
struggling public services 
•
more poverty and
•
no justice for victims of the Conflict.
Make decisions locally

Sinn Féin has helped make good changes 
in the North of Ireland. 
We have worked to protect Ireland from 
Brexit and austerity. 
We have stood up for your rights in talks 
with
•
the British Government

the United States and 
•
the European Union.
Sinn Féin supports the people of Palestine.
We want
•
stop attacks on Palestine
•
hostages to be let go

help to be given to the Palestinian 
people who need food, water, and 
medical care
•
an end to the killing of the Palestinian 
people

Standing up for Public Services
Public services are things the government 
spends money on for everyone to use. 
For example, schools and healthcare.
Sinn Féin want workers, families, and 
communities to get the best public services.
All government departments are affected 
by low funding.
Sinn Féin has fought for
•
better funding for public services
•
better support for community groups 
and farmers who lost European Union 
funding because of Brexit.
Sinn Féin helped get more money for public 
services in talks to get Stormont working 
again.
The Sinn Féin Finance Minister
•
got £688 million put towards pay for the 
people delivering public services and
•
made a better funding plan to look after 
public services.
Better Funding
11
We want to
•
fund public services properly
•
show public service workers that they 
are valued and pay them a fair wage
•
more financial control so we can 
✓control taxes and 
✓give workers better pay by law.
Sinn Féin wants to make Public Service 
budgets longer than 1 year.
This will help to make long-term plans.  
For example, plans to make hospital 
waiting times less.
We believe decisions about public services 
should be made locally.
Ministers are people chosen by the 
government to make important decisions 
about an area like education or health.  
Local Ministers 
•
understand local needs and 
•
can be held responsible for their 
decisions.
Long Term Funding

Plans for constitutional change
The constitution of a country is a special 
set of rules that say how the government 
works and what rights people have.
People are talking about changing the rules 
for the North of Ireland.
We think there is a chance to make one 
new Ireland that is stronger and fairer.
Dividing the Island of Ireland has not 
worked.
The Good Friday Agreement peace deal 
was made in 1998 to help 
✓stop conflict in the North of Ireland and 
✓everyone work together fairly.
It lets us vote on making one new Ireland 
for all the Island of Ireland.  
This new Ireland would be part of the 
European Union.
This is a fair and peaceful way to make this 
change happen.
Voting for change
We want Irish and British governments to 
set a date to vote on making one new all 
Ireland.
13
A new all Ireland is a chance for positive 
change.
For example
•
Rejoining the EU as a united Ireland.  
This would help the economy.
•
A chance to build a fairer and more 
modern society with better
✓healthcare
✓housing
✓childcare.
Everyone needs to have their voice heard 
and be included.
The Irish government needs to plan for the 
future.
We want them to set up a Citizen’s 
Assembly. 
This is a place where people can talk about 
plans for a new all Ireland.

Building a society for everyone
Sinn Féin wants everyone to have equal 
rights and chances.
Sinn Féin supports equal rights for 
everyone.
There should be no hate or unfair treatment 
because of your religion, race, gender, 
sexuality, age, or disability.
We want to stop violence against women 
and girls. 
We need a plan and to make it happen.
Equal rights for everyone
Safety and health for women
We want women to get safe health services 
that are allowed by law.
15
We want equal respect for Irish culture and 
language.  
This was promised in the Good Friday 
Agreement.
We want people affected by the Conflict to 
get information about what happened.
The British government’s Legacy Act is a 
law about past events during the Conflict. 
We are against the British Government’s 
Legacy Act which we feel stops victims of 
the Conflict getting truth and justice.
Sinn Féin support victims of the conflict 
getting truth and justice.
We want to make a society that is safe and 
welcoming for everyone.
We want a society that celebrates 
difference.
Safe and Welcoming Society
Respect for Irish Culture
Rights of Conflict Victims
16
Institutional abuse is when people are 
treated badly or unfairly in places where 
they should be taken care of.
For example, schools and care homes. 
Sinn Féin support victims of institutional 
abuse to get truth and justice.
Support for Abuse Victims
