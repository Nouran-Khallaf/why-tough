MANIFESTO
A Message From
Elections are about people and none are more important than a General Election. On the 4th July
ordinary people will make an extraordinary decision as they decide who they believe is best placed to
represent them over the next 5 years. 
As the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, I am acutely aware that we have not had a presence on the
green bench of Westminster for a number of years. Northern Ireland’s representation has been poorer for
not having Ulster Unionist MPs making the case for Northern Ireland and our place within the United
Kingdom. Our aim, this election, is to change that with your help ensuring we have an effective and
visible pro-Union voice at Westminster. 
Throughout this manifesto it will refer to people, place, prosperity, public services and peace. It is the
5Ps that underpins delivery; focusing on our economy in order to make Northern Ireland work for all.

Ulster Unionist Party Westminster Manifesto 2024
The Ulster Unionist Party wants to see change in Northern Ireland. We want to see
our economy grow through Foreign Direct Investment, by utilising and promoting
Small, Medium and Micro enterprises, by promoting a skills agenda and an
entrepreneur mentality amongst our wealth generators. We want to see stability
and continuity of devolved government that is accountable and transparent
adding value to daily life in Northern Ireland. 
This manifesto is for you, and it is you who has the ability to create real change in
Northern Ireland. It is now down to you, you have one vote, on one day with
one chance to deliver change.    
  
If you want change, vote for change, vote for the
Ulster Unionist Party on 4th July and create the
future we all want for our children.

THE UNION 
The Ulster Unionist Party stands firm in our commitment to safeguarding Northern Ireland's integral position within the
United Kingdom. During this potentially significant General Election, we wish to underscore the profound importance of
the Union, historically and in the present day and continue to fight for its preservation. 
Northern Ireland's bond with the United Kingdom is
rooted deeply in history, going back for centuries. It is
a testament to our shared values, culture, and
identity that it has endured through many trials and
triumphs. The Union has provided stability, security
and a framework for progress, enabling Northern
Ireland to thrive within the broader British family. 
The practical benefits of Northern Ireland's Union with
the rest of Great Britain are multifaceted and
encompass all aspects of life.
 
The United Kingdom offers Northern Ireland
unparalleled economic advantages. It allows for
trade with the rest of the UK and provides access to
global markets through the UK's extensive network
of trade agreements. This strengthens Northern
Ireland's economy, creates jobs, and stimulates
innovation, ensuring a brighter future for
generations to come. 
One of the most cherished benefits of the Union is
access to the National Health Service (NHS). The
NHS delivers universal healthcare, providing high-
quality medical services to all regardless of their
means, free at the point of use, giving us access to
hospitals, GPs surgeries and prescription medicines,
ensuring our families’ health and well-being are
safeguarded. 
The UK’s Armed Forces, where the people of
Northern Ireland are over-represented by share of
population, guarantees the defence and security of
Northern Ireland. In an increasingly dangerous world,
His Majesty’s Armed Forces and military provides
protection from external threats and upholds the
rule of law, fostering a safe environment for us all to
live, work, and prosper. Ulster Unionists are grateful
for the protection our Armed Forces provide the
United Kingdom and will be steadfast in our support
for service personnel, veterans and their families across
the United Kingdom. 
The Ulster Unionist Party is seeking to secure seats in
the Westminster Parliament to champion Northern
Ireland's concerns and aspirations. We will actively
engage in parliamentary debates, committees, and
legislation, advocating for policies that benefit
Northern Ireland and uphold its position within
the United Kingdom.
 
“Beyond the House of Commons, we will
work diligently to engage with the UK
government, Whitehall departments, and
policymakers in London. We will strive to
ensure that Northern Ireland's interests are
at the forefront of decision-making
processes, influencing policies that impact
our economy, society, and security.”
2
WINDSOR FRAMEWORK 
The Ulster Unionist Party is committed to
defending and promoting Northern Ireland's
place within the United Kingdom. During this
General Election, we reaffirm our dedication to
upholding the principles of the Union and ensuring
that the interests of Northern Ireland are safeguarded
at all levels of government.  
The Windsor Framework represents a stepping-stone
in addressing the challenges posed by the Northern
Ireland Protocol, a protocol that we have
campaigned against since it was forced upon
Northern Ireland. While the UUP acknowledges the
progress made through negotiations, we remain
vigilant in scrutinising the outworking of the
Framework, and future negotiations between
Westminster and the EU, to ensure that Northern
Ireland's place within the UK internal market is fully
restored.  
  
We recognise the complexities and nuances of
the Windsor Framework and acknowledge that
further reforms will be necessary to address constantly
developing concerns. The UUP will actively engage
in democratic scrutiny processes, both within the
Northern Ireland Assembly and other relevant bodies,
to challenge aspects of the Framework that
undermine Northern Ireland's sovereignty and
economic prosperity.  
The recent resumption of the Northern Ireland
Assembly is a positive step towards restoring effective 
governance and representation for the people of
Northern Ireland. The UUP is fully engaged in the
Assembly's role in scrutinising legislation, holding the
Executive to account, and representing the
diverse interests of the people of Northern
Ireland.
Using our representation on the Windsor
Framework Democratic Scrutiny Committee of
the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Ulster Unionist
Party have already highlighted genuine concerns that
this mechanism is already not fit for purpose. The
ability to effectively assess legislation and policies
emanating from the EU that might impact Northern
Ireland's position within the UK is greatly reduced by
the inability of the Scrutiny Committee to act in a
collegiate manner. We will work with a new
government at Westminster to challenge any
attempts to erode Northern Ireland's sovereignty
or undermine the integrity of the Union and will
campaign to have the existing scrutiny processes
reviewed and replaced with structures that guarantee
that safeguard.  
3
GOVERNANCE. 
OPPORTUNITIES. 
CHALLENGE.
In Westminster, the UUP will utilise any seats gained
in the 2024 General Election to represent Northern
Ireland's interests forcefully and effectively. We
will advocate for policies that promote economic
growth, protect our healthcare system, and
ensure Northern Ireland's voice is heard in
national debates while also challenging, the out
workings of the Windsor Framework that cause further
divergence between GB and Northern Ireland.
 
Through active engagement in democratic
processes, robust scrutiny of legislation, and
effective representation in Westminster, we will
ensure that Northern Ireland's interests are protected
and advanced. With a steadfast commitment to
the principles of the Union, the UUP will strive to
secure a prosperous and secure future for all the
people of Northern Ireland within the broader British
family. 
The Ulster Unionist Party is dedicated to defending and
promoting Northern Ireland's place within the Union
with the rest of Great Britain.

ECONOMY
We affirm our commitment to supporting City
Deals and Growth Deals across the Northern
Ireland, including the Belfast Region City Deal,
Derry-Londonderry and Strabane Region City Deal,
Mid South West Growth Deal, and Causeway Coast
and Glens Growth Deal. With a potential investment
of £1.3 billion, funded from Westminster and
Stormont, these initiatives will foster global centres
of innovation excellence. Harnessing the expertise
of our universities and businesses will give Northern
Ireland unprecedented opportunities for
collaboration and drive the development of
groundbreaking technologies, products, and
services. 
Addressing the challenges of a region and an
economy still gripped in a cost-of-living crisis, the
need is for far sighted leadership in order to achieve
more prosperous, sustainable and competitive
alternatives. Whilst agriculture is the largest industry
in Northern Ireland – we feed around 10 million
people across the UK and EU - and with healthy
fintech, cybersecurity, aerospace and defence
sectors, our neglected industry is tourism and
hospitality. 
Tourism and hospitality in NI represent around 4 -
5% of our Gross Value Added (GVA) to our
economy – that’s roughly £1Bn and it employs
around 65,000 directly and indirectly of our people.
With the number of visitors to Northern Ireland in the
region of 5.3 million annually, it represents an
important industry as well as a window for the world
to enjoy our unique attractions, countryside and our
welcoming population.  
Yet our tourism and hospitality sector face unfair
competition from the Republic of Ireland in terms
of pricing since the Value Added Tax regime in the
RoI is 13.5% - up recently from 12.5% but still a lot
more attractive than the 20% VAT rate in NI. The
Ulster Unionist Party will work at Westminster to seek
commitment to lower Leisure and Hospitality
VAT in Northern Ireland to match the Republic
of Ireland, allowing our hotels, restaurants and
leisure businesses to compete on a level playing field
with our closest neighbour. 
WE WILL:
We will lobby in Parliament to establish a
'Freeport Northern Ireland,' capitalising on UK
government policy to establish freeports
nationwide. Given Northern Ireland's unique
geographical circumstances and the impact of
the Northern Ireland Protocol, we advocate for
designating all ports and airports in Northern
Ireland as freeports. This comprehensive
approach will extend the benefits of freeports
across the entire region, from Londonderry to
Aldergrove, Warrenpoint, Belfast, and Larne.
We will also argue for the creation of a 'Trusted
Trader' scheme to enable businesses outside
secure port zones to access processing relief at
zero tariff rates, maximising economic benefits
for all of Northern Ireland.
5
Ulster Unionists are committed to fiscal
responsibility and effective financial stewardship.
We aim to work with Westminster to gradually
reduce Corporation Tax in Northern Ireland to
15%. Despite past fiscal mismanagement, we are
determined to showcase Northern Ireland's
potential for responsible financial management.
By implementing necessary reforms and reducing
Corporation Tax, we seek to enhance
competitiveness, attract investment and drive
economic growth throughout the Northern
Ireland. 
We also pledge to invest in skills development
through the establishment of a Northern Ireland
Job Skills Fund, akin to successful programmes in
Scotland and the Republic of Ireland. This fund,
comprising representatives from government,
business, and trade unions, will collaborate with
educational institutions to provide targeted skills
training aimed at enhancing productivity and
bolstering the economy. We commit to
dedicating funding equivalent to the UK
Apprenticeship Levy paid by Northern Ireland
firms, ensuring a minimum annual investment of
no less than £35 million into the Skills Fund.
Ulster Unionists renew our pledge to review
energy security and prices, advocating for the
creation of an All-Islands (UK & Ireland) energy
market to leverage the benefits of greater
integration with Great Britain's energy markets.
This initiative will enhance energy security,
reduce prices, and streamline regulatory
oversight, ensuring a more efficient and cost-
effective energy supply for Northern Ireland.
“These commitments underscore our
dedication to fostering prosperity,
growth, and opportunity for all
regions of the UK, ensuring
Northern Ireland's rightful place in
the global economy.” 
6
TAXATION & PENSIONS 
Ulster Unionist MPs pledge to prioritise fair and sustainable taxation policies that promote
economic growth while ensuring the well-being of all citizens, including those that have
retired. We firmly believe in maintaining the UK's 'triple lock' for state pensions, safeguarding
the financial security of our elderly population. 
The 'triple lock' for pensions is a commitment
made by the UK government to annually increase
the state pension by the highest of three measures:
inflation, average earnings growth, or a minimum
of 2.5%. This ensures that pensioners' incomes
keep pace with the rising cost of living and
national prosperity. The Ulster Unionist Party
recognises the vital importance of this policy in
providing dignity and security for retirees, many of
whom have contributed tirelessly to our society
throughout their lives. 
Furthermore, we advocate for a progressive
approach to taxation, ensuring that the burden
is distributed equitably and that those with the
means to contribute more do so responsibly. 
OUR COMMITMENTS:
Upholding the 'triple lock' for state pensions and
implementing fair taxation policies.
We reaffirm our commitment to building a
society where every individual can retire with
dignity and financial stability. 
7
“The Ulster Unionist Party’s overall
aim and vision is to build a world-
leading health and social care system
that is responsive, accessible and
delivers quality care.”
HEALTH  
Whilst we are incredibly fortunate to have a system
free at the point of delivery – just as the NHS was
originally envisaged - no one can pretend our system is
functioning as it should. Waiting times remain wholly
unacceptable, demand is outstripping capacity and
challenges remain on the recruitment and
retention of sufficient HSC workers.
Just like in January 2020, earlier this year the Ulster
Unionist Party took the courageous decision to
return to the Department of Health. We didn’t need
to, there were several other much less challenging
Department’s still available, however we stuck to our
longstanding commitment that the health and wellbeing
of the people of Northern Ireland was our number one
priority. Despite being the only single-Minister Party
within the Executive, we again demonstrated a genuine
obligation by returning to what is undoubtedly the
most difficult job in the Northern Ireland Executive. 
9
As the newly appointed Minister of Health, Robin
Swann demonstrated leadership by immediately
bringing stability to a service that had been left
reeling after a further period of political
abandonment. 
And from May this year our Minister Mike Nesbitt has
been effectively leading a system that is facing some
of its most unprecedented challenges. The greatest
of which is the devastating financial implications
of the 2024/25 Budget allocation. 
We had hoped that unanimous political commitments
made prior to the restoration of the Executive, that
health would be the number one priority, would be
honoured. But that hasn’t been the case. 
Instead of investing in our health service, the
2024/25 Budget is delivering a record £184m cut
in funding. Even after some incredibly difficult
savings this year will be implemented – as we
remain committed to delivering – the reality is
there is a shortfall in the budget. 
Whilst that remaining shortfall could be eliminated by
taking drastic action by making thousands of health
workers redundant, closing the equivalent of a large
500 bed hospital, and by ceasing almost 1million
hours of domiciliary care, the Ulster Unionist Party
will not do that. Our health service has suffered
enough from repeated political abandonment,
and we will not allow it to be abandoned on this
occasion. Making those catastrophic impact spending
cuts such as these at this time would undoubtedly inflict
unprecedented levels of suffering, and so we will simply
not allow patients to come to further avoidable harm. 
To deliver the intended benefits for our patients and
wider system, our health service must be supported
by sustainable multi-year investment.  
Yet despite the profound budget uncertainty,
opportunities do remain. The momentum for
transformation of service delivery has continued,
especially in areas such as elective and digital
transformation.
Whilst many waiting times remain intolerable, for
the first-time tangible improvements can start to be
seen across many specialities. There has been a
noticeable reduction in treatment waiting times,
with particular improvements in the number of patients
waiting for inpatient/day case surgery for General
Surgery (-21%), Trauma and Orthopaedic surgery
(-8%), ENT (-16%), Gynaecology (-22%), Urology
(-10%). 
The Ulster Unionist Party’s focus will remain on driving
through improvements in service delivery
wherever and whenever possible. That will include a
renewed focus on improved productivity and efficiency
to fully maximise capacity using existing resources.
10
OUR COMMITMENTS:
We will continue to transform services to allow
us to meet the needs of the population going
forward. This will include the identification of the
next Elective Overnight Stay Centre as well as
further commissioned activity in Day Procedure
Centres, and the continued expansion and
utilisation of mega-clinics. This will be assisted
by the publication of a HSC reconfiguration
blueprint, the publication of a multi-year plan,
as well as through the ongoing implementation
of the elective care framework, the mental
health strategy, and the cancer strategy. 
 In addition, Mike Nesbitt has brought about a
renewed determination to drive improvements in
population health and to address health
inequalities. A new targeted and innovative health
inequalities initiative will be announced in the
autumn.
Central to our healthcare system are its
dedicated staff. Prior to the pandemic, systemic
staffing issues persisted, resulting and a grossly
undervalued healthcare workforce. We commit
to our long-standing policy of maintaining pay
parity, and will continue to engage with
Executive colleagues in order to ensure
independent pay recommendations are funded
and delivered as quickly as possible.
11
In the meantime, we will continue to accelerate the
progress and savings already being delivered by
reducing the most expensive forms of agency staff,
by now also introducing a new framework to limit
hugely expensive off-contract medical and locum
costs. This will follow the success already made in
banning off-contract nursing. In parallel we will
stabilise Trust non-clinical banks, and place greater
emphasis and instil learnings from exit surveys to
address staff turnover.
Primary care serves as the health service's front
door, handling over 90% of all contacts.
Recognising its pivotal role, the Ulster Unionist
Party will continue to empower primary care to
deliver a broader range of services, including
elective services, and commit to the further
rollout of the MDT programme. 
“We will remain steadfast in investment and strengthening our social care
system. In order to deliver long-term sustainability of the sector it’s important
that we see wages climb well beyond the lowest levels. The Ulster Unionist
Party will drive through the work of the Fair Work Forum and it’s work on
developing proposals to improve terms and conditions and career prospects
for social care staff.”
A FAIRER SOCIETY
12
The Ulster Unionist Party is committed to supporting
gender equality. We will work to remove barriers
to women's participation in employment by
providing accessible, affordable childcare and
access to education, training, and transport.  
 
We support flexible working and parental leave
for both parents and making progress towards
gender-responsive budgeting, providing financial
guidance and support as women approach retirement
age, and ensuring that legislation tackling violence
against women and girls is robust and responsive to
developing challenges. We will maintain momentum
in IVF treatment availability and ensuring Northern
Ireland plays a leading role in the UK Menopause
Taskforce to improve care and support for women
experiencing menopause. We will also promote the
widely accepted definition of a woman as an adult
female and protect women’s spaces, sport and the
language used to describe women. 
The Ulster Unionist Party believes in equality for the
LGBTQ community. We support banning the
practice of conversion therapy, introduce a policy
of zero new HIV diagnoses by 2030, provide fertility
services accessible to all without discrimination,
ensure equal access to adoption and fostering and
implement a zero-tolerance approach to hate crimes
and harassment. 
Ulster Unionist Party MPs will press the next UK
government to prioritise addressing poverty and its
devastating effects in their policymaking. This must
include the abolition of the Universal Credit two-
child limit. 
 
Unpaid carers save the public purse nearly £6 billion
in Northern Ireland every year and make an
invaluable contribution to our Health and Social
Care system. To better protect their health and
wellbeing and ensure they have access to adequate
breaks, there should be a renewed focus on
providing adequate respite services. 
 
The Carer’s Allowance benefit isn’t fit for purpose
and is leaving many unpaid carers struggling to make
ends meet. The Department for Work and Pensions
should increase the value of Carer’s Allowance to
properly reflect carers’ living costs. It should also
increase the Carer’s Allowance earnings cap so
that more unpaid carers can stay in the labour market
while keeping their payments.
The Ulster Unionist Party is committed to building a fair and
united society within the United Kingdom 
Across the UK, around 16 million people have a
recognised disability, which constitutes about 24%
of the total population. This includes 11% of children,
23% of working-age adults, and 45% of pension-age
adults (Disability, accessibility and blue badge
statistics, England, 2022 to 2023 - GOV—UK;
Disability facts and figures | Disability charity Scope
UK.)
In Northern Ireland, approximately 21% of the
population reported having a disability according
to the most recent surveys, a figure that mirrors trends
across other regions of the UK, indicating a rise in
the proportion of people living with disabilities.
DISABILITIES
OUR COMMITMENTS:
Ulster Unionist Party MPs will advocate for the
next Government to not only acknowledge the
high proportion of the population living with
disabilities but also to proactively develop policy
interventions that improve services and the overall
quality of life for these citizens.
We firmly believe that the most effective way to
develop these policies is by ensuring that
individuals with lived experience are not just
included, but are at the forefront of creating these
policy interventions. Their unique perspectives and
challenges are invaluable in shaping policies that
truly meet their needs.
Additionally, your Ulster Unionist Party MPs will
work to hold the next Government to account if
they fail in their duty to support our citizens living
with disabilities in having active and fulfilling lives.
This support must include recognising that
Personal Independence Payment and other social
security payments are crucial in this regard, and
any attempt to scale back this support will have a
far-reaching and devastating impact. 
We will advocate for the next Government to
acknowledge the high proportion of the
population living with disabilities and to
proactively develop policy interventions that
improve services and the overall quality of life for
these citizens. This will include pressing for the
incorporation of the United Nations Convention
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities into UK
law, ensuring that the rights of individuals with
disabilities are fully protected and promoted.
“These statistics emphasise the significant
portion of the population living with a
disability, highlighting the crucial need for
policies and initiatives aimed at enhancing
their quality of life.”
13
The United Kingdom is in the midst of a pressing
housing crisis, with a significant number of our
citizens lacking a secure place to call home. This
dire situation has resulted in an alarming surge in
property prices and rental costs, forcing many into a
state of housing insecurity or even homelessness.
The housing crisis is a multi-faceted issue, impacting
various aspects of life, from health and education to
the justice system. It is imperative that all regions
of the UK, including Northern Ireland, unite in
their efforts to develop and implement
comprehensive housing strategies to tackle this
crisis. 
HOUSING
WE WILL:
Press the next Government to collaborate with the
devolved administrations to develop and finance a
robust strategy to tackle the housing crisis
effectively.
The Ulster Unionist Party believes that the future of Northern Ireland lies in the strength and potential of our children
and young people. We are committed to building a world-class education system that values every child, regardless of
their ability, disability, or support needs. Our pledge is to secure the necessary funding and implement policies that will
create an inclusive, supportive, and high-quality educational environment for all. 
14
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE
We will establish a single education system that: 
Values every child equally, providing tailored
support and resources to meet individual needs. 
Integrates children of all abilities, fostering a
culture of inclusivity and mutual respect. 
Promotes early support and intervention,
recognizing that early education and childcare are
crucial for the holistic development of children
and the well-being of families. 
A SINGLE EDUCATION SYSTEM
To ensure that every child gets the best start in life, we
will: 
Advocate for high-quality early education and
childcare services that are accessible and
affordable for all families. 
Support initiatives that enhance the early learning
experience, laying a strong foundation for future
academic and personal success. 
Enable families to thrive by providing flexible
childcare solutions that support parents and
caregivers. 
EARLY EDUCATION &
CHILDCARE 
We recognize that a well-resourced educational
environment is key to fostering learning and
development. Therefore, we commit to: 
Securing adequate funding to create and maintain
therapeutic learning environments that cater to the
diverse needs of all students. 
Ensuring that schools are equipped with the
necessary resources, including modern facilities
and learning materials, to support every child's
educational journey. 
THERAPEUTIC LEARNING
ENVIRONMENTS 
The success of our education system depends on the
dedication and hard work of our educators and
support staff. We will: 
Advocate for fair and competitive pay for
teachers, classroom assistants, childcare staff, and
the entire multidisciplinary team involved in
education. 
Recognise and reward the invaluable
contributions of all education professionals,
ensuring they are supported and appreciated in
their roles. 
VALUING EDUCATORS &
SUPPORT STAFF 
15
We are committed to creating equal opportunities for
young people with disabilities. To achieve this, we will: 
Secure funding and resources for post-secondary
education and training for young people with
disabilities or learning disabilities. 
Develop pathways to further learning and
employment opportunities that are on par with
those available to mainstream school leavers. 
Ensure that all young people in Northern Ireland
have access to the support and opportunities they
need to succeed, regardless of their abilities. 
SUPPORTING YOUNG PEOPLE
WITH DISABILITIES 
The Ulster Unionist Party envisions an education system where every child and young person can
thrive and reach their full potential. We will work tirelessly to secure the funding and implement
the policies necessary to make this vision a reality. Our commitment is to build an inclusive,
high-quality education system that prepares our children and young people for a bright and
successful future. 
Together, we can create a world-class education system that is a source of pride for Northern
Ireland and a foundation for our shared prosperity.

VOTE FOR IT.
VOTE FOR CHANGE.
VOTE ULSTER UNIONIST.
The Ulster Unionist Party recognises the vital role that agriculture, food production,
and our rural communities play in the economic and social fabric of Northern Ireland
and the United Kingdom as a whole.
As the party of the Union, we are committed to
supporting our farmers, agri-food businesses,
and rural areas to ensure they can thrive and
prosper.
 
The agri-food sector is the backbone of our rural
economy, contributing over £5 billion to the Northern
Ireland economy annually and employing over
100,000 people. From our world-renowned dairy
products and beef, to our premium quality
vegetables, fruits, and specialty foods, the skill
and innovation of our farmers and food producers is
a source of immense pride. 
The Ulster Unionist Party will always champion this
vital industry. We will work tirelessly to promote and
grow our agriculture and food exports, opening
new international markets and supporting our
producers to meet the evolving demands of
consumers at home and abroad. 
Farmers are the bedrock of our rural
communities. The Ulster Unionist Party recognises
the immense challenges they face, from volatile
market prices and spiralling input costs to the
increasing burden of red tape and environmental
regulations. 
Maintain and enhance Direct Payments to
farmers, ensuring they receive a fair, stable
income to invest in their businesses. 
Cut bureaucracy and streamline compliance
processes to reduce the administrative burden
on farmers. 
Increase funding for research, development and
knowledge transfer to drive innovation,
productivity, and sustainability across the
sector. 
Work in partnership with farmers to develop a
comprehensive, long-term strategy for the future
of Northern Ireland agriculture. 
WE WILL:
17
AGRICULTURE &
ENVIRONMENT
The Ulster Unionist Party understands that a thriving
rural economy is about more than just farms and
food production. It is about ensuring our villages,
towns and rural areas have access to the
infrastructure, services and opportunities they
need to prosper. 
EMPOWERING RURAL
COMMUNITIES
Invest in broadband, mobile connectivity and
transport links to end the digital and physical
isolation of rural communities. 
Support the diversification of rural economies,
backing entrepreneurship, tourism, and other
rural enterprises. 
 
Protect and enhance vital public services like
healthcare, education, and policing in our rural
areas. 
Empower local councils and community groups
to shape the future of their own areas through
dedicated rural development funding. 
Safeguard the natural environment and
biodiversity of our countryside, working closely
with farmers as the stewards of the land. 
WE WILL:
“The Ulster Unionist Party is the only party that
truly understands and champions the needs of
Northern Ireland's farmers, agri-food businesses,
and rural communities. With your support, we will
ensure they have the tools and support they need to
thrive in the years ahead. “
18
“The Ulster Unionist Party has a strong commitment to
addressing the climate emergency in Northern Ireland.”
Despite being the only part of the UK without climate
change legislation, the UUP actively pursued initiatives
to mandate the Northern Ireland Assembly and
Executive to prepare Climate Action Plans and align
with the rest of the UK in climate change mitigation
efforts. While disappointed that our proposal for
Northern Ireland's 'fair contribution' to the UK Net
Zero greenhouse gas target was not fully incorporated
into the final Bill, we remain dedicated to
achieving substantial reductions in greenhouse
gas emissions. 
 
Northern Ireland plays a significant role as a net
exporter of agri-food products, with nearly half of
all such products consumed in the rest of the UK. To
meet the UK's Net Zero target, the independent
Climate Change Committee has recommended an
82% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050
compared to 1990 levels. The Ulster Unionist Party
embraces this recommendation and will continue to
strive for an 82% or better reduction in
greenhouse gases by 2050 as part of our
comprehensive climate mitigation strategy rather than
the 100% target currently enshrined in legislation. 
We recognise that the next five years are crucial in
mitigating climate change, and the Ulster Unionist
Party is committed to ensuring that Northern Ireland
makes a fair contribution to the goal of UK Net Zero.
As part of this commitment, we support the UK's Ten
Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution,
which seeks to mobilise public and private investment
in clean technologies such as wind, carbon capture,
and hydrogen. Just as Belfast and this region played a
pivotal role in the world's first Industrial Revolution, we
believe that investing in clean technologies will enable
Northern Ireland to contribute to a New Green
Industrial Revolution and lead the world in
combating climate change. 
 
The scale and technological advancements required
to achieve these goals necessitate Northern Ireland's
continued partnership within the United Kingdom.
“By leveraging our cherished
position within the UK, we can
access the resources, expertise, and
collaborative opportunities needed
to accelerate our transition to a
low-carbon economy and safeguard
the planet for future generations.” 
19
OUR CHANGING CLIMATE
Trees capture carbon and woodlands provide habitats where wildlife can flourish therefore, Ulster Unionists
will plant more of the right trees in the right places and do more to look after the trees and woods we already
have. This will help Northern Ireland make a fair contribution to the UK’s efforts to tackle climate change whilst
also helping nature to recover, reducing the risk of flooding, creating new green jobs, and improving access to
trees and woods for everyone to enjoy. 
OUR COMMITMENTS:
Ulster Unionists understand the urgent need for a
collaborative effort to address the pressing issues
affecting Lough Neagh's water quality and long-
term sustainability. Recent multi-agency meetings
underscore the necessity of establishing a
management task force inclusive of all
stakeholders. This task force should oversee
ongoing monitoring, management and the
formulation of future plans for the Lough. 
Collaboration among Stormont Executive
departments, arms-length bodies, and
stakeholders is vital to charting a viable path
forward. It is important to maintain transparency
and engagement throughout this process to
effectively tackle the crisis affecting Lough Neagh.
Our party's long-standing advocacy for a unified
strategy underscores the necessity of proactive
measures to safeguard Lough Neagh and its
surrounding environment. 
Ulster Unionists will continue to press NI Water for
an urgent assessment of the proximity to a critical
tipping point where Lough Neagh water may
become unusable for drinking. The long absence
of an Executive at Stormont has exacerbated these
challenges, hindering our ability to implement
timely solutions. 
“The Ulster Unionist Party is resolute in its commitment to preserving the ecological integrity of Lough Neagh.
Through collaborative, cross-departmental efforts, we aim to mitigate pollution, protect wildlife, and ensure
the availability of clean drinking water for generations to come. All stakeholders must engage in proactive
dialogue and action to address this pressing environmental crisis before irreversible damage occurs. “

IF YOU WANT 
REPRESENTATION,
VOTE FOR IT.
Policing and Justice were devolved to Northern Ireland in 2010.
From that moment it has been mismanaged, poorly resourced and
badly understood. Instead of building on the resilience and
commitment of a workforce and structures that were able to operate
in the most difficult of circumstances and environment at pace,
Northern Ireland moved to a system that gutted our Policing and
Justice structures.  
Our Courts are struggling to keep up with demand
and our Prison Service have been left feeling
demoralised and marginalised. None feel valued,
none feel in control, all feel that they are working in a
reactive atmosphere instead of a proactive forward
leaning sector. 
The confidence in the Northern Ireland justice system
is at an all-time low where many believe sentencing
structures are broken and in need of a complete
overall. Victims and Witnesses of crime are seldom
informed of the progress of their case and are further
marginalised by not being informed when a prisoner is
being released. 
The Ulster Unionist Party will, at Westminster and in
Stormont, work to ensure our Policing and Justice
system are fit for purpose. 
Police first approach  - Ulster Unionists are
steadfast in our support for delivering a
headcount of 7,500 officers proposed by the
Independent Commission for Policing in
Northern Ireland over twenty years ago (“A
New Beginning: Policing in Northern Ireland”
September 1999). We believe that 500
additional police officers should be recruited
over the next 3 years, in addition to the normal
recruitment to replenish leavers.
OUR COMMITMENTS:
Attestation - Police Officers should attest at
the start of their training making them a legally
appointed police officer from their first day, in
line with other forces around the United
Kingdom. This will also allow for quicker pay
transition to a higher band on completion of
training and after probationary periods.  
Speeding Up Justice – Justice in Northern
Ireland takes twice as long as similar through
our courts than in the rest of the United
Kingdom. This has a detrimental effect on
Victims and Witnesses. Even when stronger
sentences are available, courts all too often
impose sentences at the lower end of the scale.
This has led to a lack of confidence in our
justice system. The public is also left frustrated
at the ease with which bail is granted and the
number of defendants with multiple convictions
who regard prison as an occupational
inconvenience. Deterrence seems an alien
concept to our system. Ulster Unionists will
press for stronger sentences particularly for
habitual, violent re-offenders and work to speed
up the administration of justice and the time
between arrest and sentencing. 
JUSTICE & LEGACY
22
Sentence Credit –It is not acceptable that a
perpetrator can put his victim through the trauma
of a trial and on the last day admit guilt and as
a consequence receive a reduced sentence. The
Ulster Unionist Party will propose that this and
similar practices must be stopped. This will mean
longer time spent behind bars for the perpetrator
and shorter licence periods. Ulster Unionists will
campaign for a review of the near mandatory
practice of giving serious offenders a 50/50
custodial sentence allowing for only half of the
sentence to be served. 
Stand By Victims - All too often victims have
been regarded as an afterthought by our justice
system, as the focus turns to the ‘rights’ of the
victim makers. Victims need to see a change in
culture within the justice system whereby the
State is seen to be fulfilling its duty of protecting
law abiding citizens. The police solve crimes,
courts hand out meaningful sentences and
victims are given the support they need.
Witnesses of crime are all but forgotten as our
justice system creaks and slows to a near
standstill. It is important that witnesses are kept
engaged at every level to ensure continuity of
evidence to maximise positive outcomes. 
 
Reduce Legal Aid costs and Lawfare - the
legal aid bill in Northern Ireland is out of all
proportion to the size of this Province costing
over £90m a year according to the latest
available figures. In spite of efforts to reduce the
size of the bill, it is proving difficult to achieve a
successful resolution. The situation is not helped
by the culture of lawfare which has been allowed
to develop within our legal system and which has
proved extremely lucrative for a number of firms.
More progress must be made to reduce the legal
aid bill and a league table for those legal firms
that benefit most from the legal aid system must
be published. Ulster Unionists have previously
called for a comprehensive review of legal aid in
Northern Ireland to forensically address the issue
of a legal that is by far the most generous in the
whole of the UK. All options for reform should be
on the table, including capping the legal aid bill 
and capping what solicitors can charge for certain
cases. 
Challenge Serious and Organised crime -
far too many communities across Northern
Ireland are plagued by organised criminal
gangs which are involved in serious criminal
activity including drug dealing. Some are
regarded as paramilitary or terrorist in nature,
claiming a spurious political motivation in a bid
to gain some kind of legitimacy, whilst others
are simply the type of organised criminal
enterprises that exist in major cities in the
Republic and in Great Britain. 
Over  25 years on from the Belfast Agreement, it is
incomprehensible that so-called paramilitary gangs
are still in existence. These groups need to be put
out of business permanently. Ulster Unionists want
to see a concerted effort against the leadership of
such groups with a focus on arrests and seizure of
assets to reassure the public that crime really does
not pay. 
Resource Prisons - the loss of personal liberty
is the ultimate sanction available to the UK
State for those who have broken the law and
who have damaged society. Whilst
rehabilitation is important where possible, we
must also be mindful of the need to punish,
protect society, and deter others. Ulster
Unionists want to see our Prison Service given
the resources they need - including a workforce
that is fit for purpose with the correct numbers,
terms and conditions.
It is important that we reduce the number who are
held on remand in prison by finding alternative
methods to deal with those bound over. Speeding up
justice which will naturally reduce those on bail as
they are dealt with in the court and methods such as
electronic tagging must be introduced, as it is in
England.   
23
Dealing with legacy has been something th
Ulster Unionists will engage positively with
and Information Recovery (ICRIR) but rema
(Legacy and Reconciliation) Act which denie
perpetrators. 
The Ulster Unionist Party is also
opposed to any return to the
Stormont House Agreement Legacy
proposals as they contain
elements that both deny justice
and deter truth and reconciliation. 
The funding and expansion of the PSNI Legacy
Investigation Branch to deal with all troubles
related crime including murder, attempted
murder, sexual crimes and assaults such as
‘tarring and feathering’. 
 This LIB should be enhanced by an increase in
qualified homicide investigators, funded from
Westminster from a multi-year budget, under
the command of a Deputy Chief Constable
(Legacy) answerable to the Chief Constable
and with normal oversight mechanisms.
WE SUPPORT:
LEGACY
Dealing with legacy has been something that has plagued Northern Ireland for many years. Ulster
Unionists will engage positively with the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and
Information Recovery (ICRIR) but remain opposed to the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and
Reconciliation) Act which denies justice for victims and gives amnesty to perpetrators. 
The Public Prosecution Service should be split
into two sections with one section looking at
normal workload and the second dealing purely
with legacy issues. The legacy section should be
funded by Westminster from an agreed multi-
year budget. 
The LIB and PPS (Legacy) would work within
Northern Ireland and engage with other
jurisdictions to investigate all troubles related
crimes when information ensuring for everyone
is given the opportunity for justice and
accountability. 
24
DEFENCE & SECURITY 
The UK is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, it is a major contributor to NATO and has multi-lateral
and bi-lateral defence agreements right across the globe. Collective Defence remains our greatest asset and allows
the UK to continue to stand up, and speak out, in defence of freedom and democracy wherever it is threatened. 
For over 300 years Irishmen, and more recently
women, have served in the UK Armed Forces. They
have served with distinction at Trafalgar,
Waterloo, The Somme, D-Day landings, Imjin River
in Korea and more recently Iraq and Afghanistan.
Those same fighting Irish were found peacekeeping
in Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Mali.
Their exploits are legendary, but it is the changing
nature of conflicts that is of concern today. 
Russia poses a genuine threat to the wider
European region. Their brutal invasion of
Ukraine has drawn battle lines between NATO
and the Russian Federation along with its allies to
be found in China, North Korea and Belarus. 
The UK has led the support for Ukraine and
here in Northern Ireland we have played our part
with the manufacturing of NLAW missiles - the
main anti-armour weapons being used by the
Ukrainian armed forces. Our capacity to increase
defence output remains high with the manufacture
of surface to air missiles, such as HVM, to tackle
Russia’s increasing air power. 
We have gone, according to the Secretary of State
for Defence – Grant Shapps MP – from a post-
war world to a pre-war world. This is something
we must take seriously here in Northern Ireland -
the UK must take Northern Irelands strategic
position seriously when defence planning. 
We live in a world which has never been less secure since the Cold War. There are multiple
conflicts raging throughout the world in places like Syria, Southern Sudan, Mali, Yemen, the
middle East and of course Ukraine. As a nation we must always remain prepared by maintaining
our capabilities across the full spectrum of conflict. 
25
Limited patrolling of our western approaches
out to the ‘Greenland-Iceland-UK Gap’
undermines UK and Europe’s defences. Our
ability to react to Russian intelligence shipping and
warships is limited and the Irish Governments
ability to protect its own underseas cabling is non-
existent. Ireland’s preparedness is abysmal and
their reliance on others unsustainable. 
Across Europe nations are committing to over 2%
of their national GDP to Europe’s collective
defence - all except Ireland.  As our nearest
neighbour their lack of defence maturity has an
adverse effect on UK and Europe’s ability to react
to threats from Russia and their acolytes. 
Therefore, it is important that Northern Ireland is
brought into the UK’s ‘National Defence
Command’ structures. This means an increase in
naval assets stationed in Northern Ireland as well
as an enhanced RAF presence to enable quick
interception of hostile aircraft.  
Both defence platforms, RN and RAF, can assist
with the protection of rapid deployments of
military assets from the US and Canada via either
Shannon or Aldergrove airports. This creates two
important airheads allowing for redundancy if
Ireland was to regress further from providing
support to deploying US assets. 
WE COMMIT TO:
Support the establishment of a Naval Base in
Northern Ireland allowing NATO assets to be
deployed from here to increase patrolling of our
western approaches. 
Encourage the Republic of Ireland to take
defence seriously and enhance their Partnership
and Cooperation Programme, or join NATO,
and commit to spending 2% of GDP on
defence. 
Support Aldergrove Military Base reverting back
to an RAF station with the ability to forward
mount air frames alleviating the burden on
Scottish bases and allowing them to
concentrate on the UK’s Northern approaches. 
Vote to increase UK Defence Spending beyond
the NATO Target of 2% of national GDP to
2.5%. 
Lobby to increase Northern Irelands share of
the defence industry manufacturing base
including research and development. 
Maintain our Armed Forces in Northern Ireland,
both Regular and Reserve, not below 3000
personnel. 
Continue to support our independent nuclear
deterrent via the Trident systems. 
26
VETERANS 
The Ulster Unionist Party is committed to supporting service
personnel, veterans and their families across the United Kingdom.
We will advocate for the retention of the Office for Veterans' Affairs
(OVA) with a cabinet attending Minister to ensure consistent support
for veterans living in England, Northern Ireland, Wales, and
Scotland. To enhance coordination and service delivery, we will push
for the OVA to have a properly resourced presence in each of the
devolved regions, which utilises the knowledge and networks built up
by the Northern Ireland Veterans Support Office.
Recognising the challenges faced by medically
discharged veterans, we will commission an
independent review of the medical discharge
process to identify gaps in support and
inconsistencies. Our aim is to ensure that those
leaving service due to injury or illness receive the full
range of support they deserve as they transition to
civilian life. 
Northern Ireland has consistently contributed more
service personnel per head of population than
elsewhere in the UK. Those who have served, at
home and abroad, deserve support once they
have left service. This means delivering on the
promise’s made within the Armed Forces Covenant.
The Ulster Unionist Party remains dedicated to
advocating for the rights and well-being of our
service personnel, veterans, and their families,
ensuring that they receive the recognition, support,
and respect they deserve for their sacrifices and
service to our country. 
OUR COMMITMENTS 
TO VETERANS:
We will address existing disparities in the
application of military compensation when
determining eligibility for social security support
across the UK. Additionally, we will advocate
for the inclusion of chronic pain as a
compensable condition within the Armed Forces
Compensation Scheme and press for the
establishment of a compensation scheme for
Nuclear Test Veterans and their families. 
Building upon previous successes we will
support veteran families by removing
application fees for non-UK citizens who have
served in the UK Armed Forces for four years or
more for the Veterans Hearing Loss Fund and
the Veterans Mobility Fund. This will provide
essential support and equipment for veterans
with hearing loss and mobility issues resulting
from their service.
We are committed to fulfilling our moral
obligation to Afghan Locally Employed Civilians
by expediting the resettlement process for
eligible family members who supported our
service personnel during the Afghanistan
conflict. 
27
Additionally, we will argue that the next
Government should honour the commitment by
the previous Government for the creation of an
appropriate financial redress scheme for LGBT+
veterans who were wrongfully discharged prior
to the lifting of the pre-2000 ban on
homosexuality in the Armed Forces. 
Continue to work with the Northern Ireland
Veterans Commissioner and the UK Minister of
State for Veterans Affairs to ensure the Armed
Forces Covenant is delivered in Northern Ireland
for veterans.
“We should honour the sacrifice 
and commitment of our Armed Forces.”
28
IMMIGRATION
Controlled Immigration is important to all
countries across the world. In the UK it has helped
create a skilled workforce. Many doctors, nurses and
other Health Care professionals come from other
countries around the world, setting up home in
Northern Ireland and contributing to our society in a
positive way. Northern Ireland is also heavily reliant
on ethnic minorities from other countries to carry out
highly intensive manual jobs within the agri-food
industry.  
For those who wish to make Northern Ireland their
home and contribute we must do all we can to
make them welcome. We must support them as they
integrate into our society through our education and
health systems and absorb our values of tolerance,
hard work and civic responsibility, adding value to who
we are. 
 
Those asylum seekers who come here fleeing
persecution from places like Afghanistan, Syria,
Ukraine and Hong Kong should also be welcome
and their applications dealt with at speed and with
diligence to ensure all is correct. It is especially
important that families with young children or single
mothers are processed swiftly. 
Illegal immigration undermines our systems, creates a
burden on public services and prevents genuine asylum
seekers being deal with in a timely manner. 
The market in people trafficking and illegal
immigration has now become big business. It is
cruel and exploitative, and must be challenged
and brought to a halt.  
 
Our immigration system must be open,
transparent and fair. We must target the traffickers,
who put people’s lives at risk for profit, as our main
defence in reducing illegal immigration. 
WE WILL:
Have a zero-tolerance policy on illegal
immigration, while being responsive to genuine
asylum seekers. 
Support government measures to target the
people traffickers through cooperation with other
European countries.  
Increase the number of staff working on asylum
applications threefold to allow genuine asylum
seekers to receive their application decision
quicker and when granted asylum to integrate
fully into UK society. 
Fast track asylum application for families with
children, single mothers or those who have a
protected professions such as doctors or
pharmacists. 
30
Northern Ireland has moved away from the old binary
labelling of Orange and Green. We are now a multi-
cultural society with a variety of ethnic minorities who
call this place home while they continue to celebrate
their culture through music, dance, the written word,
religion and food. It has created a diversity in Northern
Ireland that is enriching, welcoming and positive. 
  
There are a minority of people in Northern Ireland that
feel threatened by multi-cultural diversity and are
intimidating those from differing ethnic backgrounds
resulting in some newcomers feeling isolated and
scared. This is totally unacceptable. The Ulster
Unionist Party will work across civic society and
support the police to end this unacceptable behaviour. 
WE WILL:
Continue to support a Racial Equality Strategy for
Northern Ireland. 
Promote a multi-cultural society that ensures
ethnic minorities have the opportunity to
integrate throughout Northern Ireland.  
Ensure funding for ethic minority and religious
groups, including cultural events, is fair and
proportionate building on the Belfast Mela
celebrations as best practice. 
“Immigration has created a
diversity in Northern Ireland that is
enriching, welcoming and positive.”
Support the Police Service of Northern Ireland
and civic society to address and end race related
intimidation and discrimination. 
Support people from minority ethnic backgrounds
who fully contribute to our society, through
education, the economy, health services,
community activities, sports and the arts. 
31
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  
In the modern era, few technological advancements
have captured the imagination quite like Artificial
Intelligence (A.I.). At its core, A.I. refers to the
simulation of human intelligence processes by
machines, particularly computer systems. It
encompasses a wide array of capabilities, including
learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and
language understanding. As we stand on the cusp of
a new age of innovation, the Ulster Unionist Party
recognises the transformative potential of A.I. and is
committed to harnessing its power for the
betterment of Northern Ireland. 
A.I. technologies are already permeating various
aspects of our lives, from virtual assistants on our
smartphones to sophisticated algorithms powering
recommendation systems on streaming platforms.
Machine learning, a subset of A.I., enables systems to
improve their task performance through experience.
Deep learning, another subset, employs neural
networks with many layers to analyse and process
complex data. These technologies hold immense
promise across numerous sectors, including
healthcare, transportation, finance, education
and beyond.
The benefits of A.I. are diverse and far-reaching.
Enhanced efficiency and productivity are perhaps the
most immediate advantages, as A.I. systems can
automate repetitive tasks, freeing up human
resources for more creative and strategic
endeavours. A.I. also has the potential to
revolutionise healthcare, facilitating early disease
detection, personalised treatment plans and drug
discovery. 
In agriculture, A.I. applications can optimise crop
yields and mitigate environmental impact through
precision farming techniques. Furthermore, A.I.
can bolster cybersecurity efforts, detect fraudulent
activities, and improve overall safety across various
digital networks. 
While the promise of A.I. is undeniable, it is crucial to
acknowledge and mitigate potential risks.
Concerns regarding job displacement loom large,
as automation could render certain professions
obsolete, exacerbating socioeconomic inequalities.
Ethical considerations surrounding data privacy,
algorithmic bias, and autonomous decision-making
also demand careful scrutiny. Additionally, there are
existential risks associated with the development of
superintelligent A.I. systems, necessitating robust
governance frameworks to ensure alignment with
human values and objectives. 
As supporters of progress and innovation, the Ulster
Unionist Party is committed to fostering an ecosystem
that encourages the responsible development and
deployment of A.I. technologies. 
32
WE COMMIT TO:
Investment in Research and Development: We
will advocate for increased public and private
investment in A.I. research and development,
fostering collaboration between universities, the
private sector and government to drive
innovation and technological advancement. 
Skills Development and Education: Recognising
the importance of human capital in realising the
potential of A.I., we will champion initiatives to
upskill and reskill the workforce, ensuring that
Northern Ireland remains competitive in the
global digital economy. 
Ethical and Regulatory Frameworks: We will
work in Parliament to establish robust ethical
and regulatory frameworks governing the
development and deployment of A.I.
technologies, prioritising transparency,
accountability, and fairness to mitigate potential
risks and safeguard public trust. 
Promotion of A.I. Adoption: Through targeted
incentives and support mechanisms, we will
encourage businesses and organisations across
Northern Ireland to embrace A.I. technologies,
leveraging their transformative potential to drive
economic growth and societal progress.
International Collaboration: Recognising that A.I.
transcends national boundaries, we will
encourage international collaboration and
cooperation on A.I. governance and standards,
fostering a global consensus on ethical
standards and best practices. 
The Ulster Unionist Party envisions a future where A.I. serves as a catalyst for positive change,
empowering individuals, enhancing productivity and advancing the collective welfare of
Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.
“By embracing innovation with prudence and
foresight,  we can harness the full potential of A.I.
to build a brighter, more prosperous future for
generations to come.”
