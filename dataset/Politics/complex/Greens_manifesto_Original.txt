green party co-leaders
Millions of people in our country are 
feeling insecure and deeply worried 
about the future. 
We live in one of the richest countries 
on the planet, yet nurses are using 
food banks, our children’s schools are 
crumbling, a roof over our heads is all 
too often unaffordable, and hospital 
and dentist appointments are like 
gold dust. 
Meanwhile, the climate emergency 
continues to accelerate. Scientists 
warn that we are currently on track 
for global temperatures to rise by 
at least 2.5oC, far beyond levels at 
which humanity can safely survive.
Our promise to you is that all this can 
change. We can create a greener, 
fairer country together – one in which 
we are all safer, happier and more 
fulfilled. 
It will take MPs prepared to make 
brave, principled choices on your 
behalf. And it will take the kinds of 
policies set out in this manifesto, for 
which elected Green MPs will fight 
hard every single day for you.
Voting Green on 4th July is your way of 
showing you believe a fairer, greener 
world is possible – and is worth 
fighting for.

You can find more detail on these and our other policies  
in our full manifesto. 
This manifesto is about the UK general election 2024, so 
references to ‘country’ refer to the UK as a whole, as do data cited, 
except when specifically stated as referring to England. However, 
where policy areas are devolved to the Scottish Parliament, 
Senedd Cymru, and the Northern Irish Assembly, we recognise the 
democratic right for these bodies to set their own policy agendas, 
and that these are decided upon at devolved elections. Wales 
Green Party will be publishing its own manifesto with more detail 
about its proposals in these areas. The Scottish Green Party is 
a distinct political party and its general election manifesto will 
reflect the devolved settlement.

Providing FAIRER, GREENER HOMES for all 
Providing FAIRER,  
GREENER HOMES  
for all 
Everyone needs a warm, secure 
and affordable home. Yet millions 
of people don’t have this most 
basic building-block for a happy 
and successful life. Over a million 
households are on council waiting 
lists and more than 130,000 children 
are growing up in temporary 
accommodation.
Our Right Homes, 
Right Place, Right Price 
Charter 
Local authorities and national 
government need to work together 
to deliver homes people can afford to 
rent or buy, where people need them. 
Our Right Homes, Right Place, Right 
Price Charter will simultaneously 
protect valuable green space 
for communities, reduce climate 
emissions, tackle fuel poverty 
and provide genuinely affordable 
housing. It would:
•	 Require local authorities to 
spread small developments 
across their areas.
•	 Require all new developments 
to be accompanied by the extra 
investment needed in local 
health, transport and other 
services.
•	 Ensure that all new homes 
meet Passivhaus or equivalent 
standards and house builders 
include solar panels and heat 
pumps on all new homes, where 
appropriate.
Our Fairer, Greener 
Homes Guarantee 
Our energy bills are far too high 
because we have the worst-insulated 
homes in Europe. We would bring 
down bills by reducing the loss of heat 
from homes, because the cheapest 
bill is the one you don’t have to pay.
Elected Greens will push for a local-
authority-led, street-by-street retrofit 
programme to insulate our homes, 
provide clean heat and start to 
adapt our buildings to more extreme 
climate conditions. This would mean 
investment of:
•	 £29bn over the next five years 
to insulate homes to an EPC B 
standard or above as part of a 
ten-year programme. 
•	 £4bn over the next five years to 
insulate other buildings to a high 
standard.

Real Hope.

•	 £9bn over the next five years 
for low-carbon heating systems 
(e.g. heat pumps) for homes 
and other buildings. 
150,000 new social 
homes each year 
We pledge to provide 150,000 new 
social homes every year through:
•	 New build and the purchase/
refurbishment of older housing 
stock.
•	 A community right to buy for 
local authorities for several 
categories of property.
•	 Ending the individual ‘right to 
buy’, to keep social homes for 
local communities in perpetuity.
Our Fair Deal for Renters
Millions of private renters face 
unaffordable rents and constant 
insecurity. 
Green MPs will push for:
•	 Rent controls so local 
authorities can control 
rents if the rental market is 
unaffordable for many local 
people.
•	 A new stable rental tenancy 
and an end to no-fault 
evictions so tenants are secure 
in their homes and don’t have 
their lives turned upside down 
on the whim of their landlords. 
We will also introduce a tenants’ 
right to demand energy 
efficiency improvements.
•	 Private residential tenancy 
boards to provide an informal, 
cheap and speedy forum for 
resolving disputes before they 
reach a tribunal.

Greens have been in administration in Stroud for the 
past decade and have ensured that residents now 
have many more high-quality social homes. Council 
house building has been a key plank of their programme 
since 2014, with nearly 300 council homes built since 
then, all to the highest environmental standards. The 
Green-led Council plans to further increase social 
housing by over 100 homes over the next five years 
by redeveloping older sites, building new homes 
and requiring developers to provide more affordable 
homes. It is also implementing a multi-million-pound 
investment to bring all council houses up to modern 
standards of efficiency and comfort.
Stroud’s ambition has been undermined by ‘right to 
buy’, something Green MPs will be fighting to change 
in Parliament.

Building A FAIRER, HEALTHIER COUNTRY
Building A FAIRER, 
HEALTHIER COUNTRY
The NHS faces the worst crisis 
in its 80-year history. This is the 
result of deliberate Conservative 
under-funding that’s seen the 
NHS undermined and at risk of 
collapse, paving the way for further 
privatisation. 
The Green Party is committed to a 
fully public, properly funded health 
and social care system, and to 
keeping the profit motive well away 
from the NHS. 
Green MPs will push for: 
•	 A year-on-year reduction in 
waiting lists.
•	 Guaranteed access to an NHS 
dentist. 
•	 Guaranteed rapid access to 
a GP and same day access in 
case of urgent need.
•	 An immediate boost to the 
pay of NHS staff, including the 
restoration of junior doctors’ 
pay, to help with staff retention.
To meet these aims, we estimate 
that the NHS in England will require 
additional annual expenditure of 
£8bn in the first full year of the next 
Parliament, rising to £28bn in total 
by 2030. Additional capital spending 
of at least £20bn is needed over the 
next five years for hospital building 
and repair.
Investing in GPs and public health 
is key to prevention, early diagnosis 
and improving our quality of life, while 
also reducing the burden on the NHS. 
Green MPs will push for: 
•	 Increasing the allocation of 
funding to primary medical 
care, with additional annual 
spending reaching £1.5bn by 
2030.
•	 Restoring public health 
budgets to 2015/16 levels with 
an immediate annual increase 
of £1.5bn. Smoking cessation, 
drug and alcohol treatment and 
sexual health services all need 
to be properly funded. 
•	 A National Commission to agree 
an evidenced-based approach 
to reform of the UK’s counter-
productive drugs laws.
NHS dentistry
Green MPs will end the systematic 
underfunding of dentistry and the 
scandal of dental treatment deserts 
by pushing for: 
•	 A new NHS dentists’ contract 
so that dentists are properly

rewarded for taking on NHS 
patients.
•	 Additional investment in NHS 
dentistry reaching £3bn a year 
by 2030.
•	 Funding for community hubs 
and primary care to roll-out free 
dental nursing for children and 
those on low incomes. 
Mental health  
and neurodiversity
There’s been a dramatic rise in 
mental health problems in recent 
years, particularly among young 
people, with far too many unable to 
access help when they need it.
Elected Greens will press for:
•	 A legal framework that supports 
the rights of those struggling 
with their mental health to be 
respected and to live fulfilling 
lives.
•	 Increased funding for mental 
health care, putting it on an 
equal footing with physical 
health care and enabling people 
to access evidence-based 
mental health therapies within 
28 days.
•	 A trained and paid counsellor 
in every school and sixth-form 
college.
•	 Readily available tailored 
provision to meet the needs of 
communities of colour, children 
and adolescents, older people 
and LGBTIQA+ communities.
•	 Adequate support in the school 
system for neurodivergent 
children and children with 
special educational needs. 
Assisted dying
Elected Greens will support a change 
in the law to legalise assisted dying 
for people  suffering from terminal 
disease who wish to avoid prolonged 
unnecessary suffering, if this is 
their clear and settled will. Proper 
safeguards would be put in place.
End new cases of HIV  
by 2030
Green MPs will work towards no 
more HIV transmissions by 2030, 
advocating for a joined-up evidence 
based approach, including access 
to the HIV prevention pill online, in 
pharmacies and from GP services, 
and renewing successful opt-out 
HIV testing programmes in A&Es in all 
areas with a high prevalence of HIV.

Building A FAIRER, HEALTHIER COUNTRY
In 2015, Green MP Caroline Lucas was the first to 
champion the cross-party NHS Reinstatement Bill 
to protect our NHS from creeping marketisation 
and privatisation, and ensure that NHS services are 
both publicly paid for and publicly provided. Caroline 
brought campaigners, grassroots organisations, 
health experts and other MPs together in Westminster 
to make the case for an NHS in public hands.  
The NHS Bill was a vital blueprint to roll back NHS 
privatisation and reinstate founding NHS principles 
– truly public, fully protected, always free at point of 
delivery. Caroline gave a voice to all those who want 
to protect the NHS we love from being dismantled and 
undermined by bidding wars and market structures 
that take billions away from patient care. The Bill 
showed the strength of cross-party and public 
support for the NHS to be run with patients, not profit, 
at its heart, and for a comprehensive rescue package 
to fully protect it from the private sector.

CARING WITH fairness, COMPASSION AND DIGNITY
CARING WITH 
fairness, 
COMPASSION  
AND DIGNITY
Over 400,000 people are awaiting 
care reviews, payments or 
assessments, and there are 150,000 
staff vacancies in the care sector. In 
England, there are estimated to be 
4.7 million unpaid carers. 
To address this crisis and help take 
pressure off the NHS, Green MPs will 
push for investment of £20bn to: 
•	 Introduce free personal care 
along the lines successfully 
brought in by the Scottish 
Government, to ensure dignity 
in old age and for the disabled.
•	 Increase pay rates and  
introduce a career structure 
for carers to rebuild the care 
workforce.
For those still living at home, 
this will enable earlier access 
to help maintain independence 
and wellbeing. For those living in 
residential settings, the personal 
care elements will be fully funded, 
alongside a tapered approach to 
other costs based on the level of 
income. For those struggling to 
afford the accommodation element 
of residential care, including because 
their spouse is still in the family 
home, local authorities need to be 
properly funded to provide the right 
level of financial support.
Elected Greens will also push for:
•	 An additional £3bn to enable 
local authorities to provide 
high-quality children’s social 
care.

CREATING A FAIRER, GREENER ECONOMY
CREATING A FAIRER, 
GREENER ECONOMY 
Green MPs will fight for an economy 
that delivers security, wellbeing and 
a better quality of life for everyone, 
as well protecting our environment 
and enabling us to tackle the climate 
crisis with the ambition and speed it 
demands.
Privatisation has failed. Dividends 
are paid to shareholders while 
infrastructure is run into the ground. 
The Green Party is committed to the 
public ownership of public services, 
so they are run to serve us all, rather 
than to increase the wealth of 
shareholders.
Elected Greens would push for a 
Green Economic Transformation to 
include:
•	 A £40bn investment per year in 
the shift to a green economy 
over the course of the next 
Parliament. 
•	 A carbon tax to drive fossil fuels 
out of our economy and raise 
money to invest in the green 
transition. 
•	 Bringing the railways, water 
companies and the Big 5 retail 
energy companies into public 
ownership.
We need to build the sustainability 
of our communities through the 
transition. 
Green MPs will push for: 
•	 A £12.4bn investment in skills 
and training, equipping workers 
to play a full role in the green 
economy. 
•	 A share of community 
ownership in local sustainable 
energy infrastructure such as 
wind farms.
Taxing wealth fairly  
and borrowing to invest
While our public services are crying 
out for investment, the number of 
billionaires in the UK has risen from 
29 to 171 since 2010. Elected Greens 
will push for major changes to the tax 
system to simplify and align the rates 
of tax paid on income and investment 
gains, whatever their source, and to 
fairly tax excessive concentrations 
of wealth. These measures should 
include:
•	 A Wealth Tax of 1% annually on 
assets above £10 million and of 
2% on assets above £1bn. Only 
a tiny minority of people would 
pay this tax.
•	 Reform of Capital Gains Tax 
(CGT) to align the rates paid 
16

Real Change.
by taxpayers on income and 
taxable gains. This would affect 
less than 2% of all income 
taxpayers. 
•	 Aligning the tax rates on 
investment income with the 
tax and National Insurance 
Contribution rates on 
employment income. 
•	 Removing the Upper Earnings 
Limit that restricts the amount 
of National Insurance paid by 
high earners. 
We estimate that by the end of the 
next Parliament these changes could 
raise additional revenue of between 
£50 and £70bn per year in 2024 
prices. A carbon tax set initially at 
£120 per tonne of carbon emitted and 
rising over ten years to a maximum of 
£500 per tonne, would raise up to an 
additional £80bn.
We are prepared to borrow to invest. 
Allowing ourselves to be trapped 
in a self-imposed fiscal straitjacket 
is a false economy. Investing in 
protecting our climate now will 
save vast costs in the future, and 
spending on decent public services 
and fit-for-purpose infrastructure is 
essential for a flourishing future for 
us all. 
SME and community 
sector support 
Small and medium-sized business 
are the lifeblood of our economy and 
our communities. 
Green MPs will press for:
•	 Regional mutual banks to be 
set up to drive investment 
in decarbonisation and local 
economic sustainability. 
•	 £2bn per year in grant funding 
for local authorities to help 
businesses decarbonise.
•	 Community ownership to be 
encouraged through greater 
access to government funding 
in the transition to a zero-
carbon economy.

CREATING A FAIRER, GREENER ECONOMY
South Oxfordshire:  
Greens good with money
In 2019, Greens formed a coalition administration in 
South Oxfordshire. They inherited an annual deficit of 
£3m, caused by insufficient attention on the Council’s 
income by the previous Conservative administration. 
Green Councillors suspected that not all business 
rates were being collected, so directed officers to 
appoint external consultants to identify uncollected 
back taxes. As a result, £2.6 million in back taxes was 
collected.

Powering up 
FAIRER, GREENER 
Energy
Accelerating clean 
energy investment  
and delivery
The UK’s current climate targets 
do not reflect the urgency of the 
climate crisis. We would push the 
Government to transition to a zero-
carbon society as soon as possible, 
and more than a decade ahead of 
2050.
This ambition will deliver a zero-
carbon electricity supply and 
security of supply over short and 
long periods of low generation, with 
sufficient electricity for all cars and 
vans to be electric, for all homes and 
buildings to stop using fossil fuels, 
and for most industry to transition to 
clean energy.
Elected Greens will push for:
•	 Wind to provide around 70% of 
the UK’s electricity by 2030.
•	 Delivery of 80GW of offshore 
wind, 53 GW of onshore wind, 
and 100 GW of solar by 2035.
•	 Investment in energy storage 
capacity and more efficient 
electricity distribution.
•	 Communities to own their 
own energy sources, ensuring 
they can use any profit from 
selling excess energy to reduce 
their bills or benefit their 
communities.
Phasing out fossil fuels
•	 Cancel recent fossil fuel 
licences such as for Rosebank 
and stop all new fossil fuel 
extraction projects in the UK. 
•	 Remove all oil and gas 
subsidies.
•	 Introduce a carbon tax on 
all fossil fuel imports and 
domestic extraction, based 
on greenhouse gas emissions 
produced when fuel is burned.
Nuclear power
We want to see the phase-out of 
nuclear energy, which is unsafe 
and much more expensive than 
renewables. The development 
of nuclear power stations is too 
slow given the pace of action 
we need on climate. They also 
create unmanageable quantities 
of radioactive waste and are 
inextricably linked with the 
production of nuclear weapons.

Greens acting to 
reduce energy bills
Greens on South Oxfordshire Council have linked grant 
funding for new affordable housing to the provision of 
homes that are cheap to run because they don’t rely 
on fossil fuels. They’ve also committed to putting the 
Council’s own house in order by targeting Council 
operations to be net-zero by 2025 and moving its 
pension fund away from investments in fossil fuels. 
When Council officers in Somerset West and Taunton 
said it would be unaffordable to upgrade 5,700 council 
homes, Green councillors set up a working party to put 
together a plan for cheaper energy bills. The three-
stage process is ensuring that all these homes will see 
basics like ventilation and insulation fixed by 2030, with 
a complete switch away from fossil fuels by 2050.

Making work fair
Making work fair
Millions of people have seen their pay 
seriously eroded by inflation for well 
over a decade, including many who 
work in vital public services. Green 
MPs will defend and extend workers’ 
rights to organise in the workplace, 
pushing for: 
•	 Repeal of current anti-union 
legislation and its replacement 
with a positive Charter of 
Workers’ Rights, with the right 
to strike at its heart along with a 
legal obligation for all employers 
to recognise trade unions.
•	 A maximum 10:1 pay ratio for 
all private- and public-sector 
organisations.
•	 An increase in the minimum 
wage to £15 an hour, no matter 
your age, with the costs 
to small businesses offset 
by reducing their National 
Insurance payments.
•	 Equal employment rights for all 
workers from their first day of 
employment, including those 
working in the ‘gig economy’ 
and on zero-hours contracts. 
Gig employers that repeatedly 
break employment, data 
protection or tax law will be 
denied licences to operate.
•	 A move to a four-day working 
week.

SOCIAL SUPPORT
Most of us want to live in a country 
where everyone is treated with 
dignity, not one where record 
numbers of children are in poverty, 
older people can’t keep warm and 
disabled people are badly let down. 
We can do so much better, lifting 
everyone up and making sure all of  
us can access extra help when we 
need it.
To tackle the cost-of-living crisis for 
the poorest in our society and make 
the social security system fairer and 
less punitive, elected Greens will 
campaign to:
•	 Increase Universal Credit and 
legacy benefits by £40 a week. 
•	 Abolish the two-child benefit 
cap, lifting 250,000 children out 
of poverty. 
•	 End the ‘bedroom tax’.
•	 In the long term, introduce a 
universal basic income to give 
everybody the security to start 
a business, study, train and live 
their life in dignity. 
Disabled people
Disabled people have as much  
right to lead full, meaningful lives  
as everyone else.
Green MPs will push to: 
•	 Restore the value of disability 
benefits, with an immediate 
uplift of 5%. 
•	 Reform intrusive eligibility tests 
like PIP and the unfair targeting 
of carers and disabled people 
on benefits.
•	 Make it mandatory for councils 
to provide free transport for  
16-18 year old pupils with  
special educational needs  
and disabilities.

BRINGING NATURE 
BACK TO LIFE
We are part of nature and unless it 
flourishes, we cannot flourish either, 
but the UK is one of the most nature-
depleted countries in the world.   
To protect and restore nature, 
Elected Greens will campaign to:
•	 Introduce a new Rights of 
Nature Act, giving rights to 
nature itself. 
•	 End the scandal of sewage 
pouring into our rivers and seas 
by taking the water companies 
back into public ownership.
•	  Extend people’s access to 
green space and waterways 
close to where they live with a 
new English Right to Roam Act.
•	 Set aside 30% of our land and 
seas by 2030 in which nature 
will receive the highest priority 
and protection.
Green MPs will also press for:
•	 An immediate end to the 
emergency authorisation of 
bee-killing pesticides.
•	 A new Clean Air (Human Rights) 
Act, giving everyone the right to 
breathe clean air.

Lewes: giving rights to nature

Green-led Lewes District Council acted to protect 
the River Ouse from pollution by making it the first 
river in England to be granted legal rights, as part 
of a growing movement to bolster protection for 
nature through the law. Our waterways are being 
used as a free dumping ground for pollution from 
agriculture, new housing developments and water 
company spillages. Like the Green councillors in 
Lewes, Green MPs will always fight to protect the 
health of our rivers and the many people who enjoy 
them. Nature can’t vote, but you can!

Jenny Jones: fighting for 
clean water – and winning
Green Party Baroness Jenny Jones led the rebellion 
in the House of Lords that stopped the government 
scrapping 
‘nutrient 
neutrality’ 
rules 
thereby 
protecting some of our most precious water systems 
from pollution. The Labour Party initially backed 
Conservative plans to scrap these and leave taxpayers 
with the clean-up bills, but Jenny successfully pushed 
them to support her ‘fatal motion’ to stop this move. 
Jenny has used her profile in Parliament to make public 
ownership of water one of the key asks of the next 
government. Private water companies have taken 
our money for over thirty years and paid it out to 
shareholders rather than investing in a sewage system 
that’s fit for purpose. Only public ownership will fix this 
problem for good.

Green MPs will push for:

•	 A ban on all blood sports, 
including trail hunting.
•	 All UK domestic and overseas 
territorial waters to offer the 
highest level of protection to 
marine life.
•	 An end to badger culling. 
•	 An end to factory farming, 
enforcement of maximum 
stocking densities, and no 
routine use of antibiotics in 
farm animals.
•	 A complete ban on close 
confinement in cages and the 
deliberate and unnecessary 
mutilation of farm animals.

as locally as possible.
Elected Greens will push for:
•	 Financial support for farmers 
to be almost tripled to support 
their transition to nature-friendly 
farming.
•	 Biodiversity and soil health to be 
conserved and improved, leading 
to cleaner rivers.
•	 Farm payments to be linked to 
reduced use of pesticides and 
other agro-chemicals.
•	 All children to have a free school 
meal each day and free breakfast 
clubs for children to Year 6. 
•	 Schools to involve children  
in growing, preparing and 
cooking food, as part of the  
core curriculum.
•	 Policies that ensure that  
good quality surplus food is  
not wasted. 
Fairer, greener 
food and farming
Our food system is failing us all. 
Poor diets are estimated to cost our 
NHS £6.5bn a year yet successive 
governments have failed to take on 
the unhealthy food lobby. Meanwhile, 
the way we produce our food is 
damaging our natural world and our 
climate. Our food system accounts 
for a third of all greenhouse gas 
emissions and is the greatest driver 
of nature loss and pollution in our 
rivers. 
Green MPs will work with farmers and 
other stakeholders to transform our 
food and farming system, so we are 
producing healthy, nutritious food 
at fair prices for consumers and with 
fair wages for growers. We will also 
aim to increase the amount of food

FAIRER, GREENER 
TRANSPORT
Our transport choices account 
for around a quarter of carbon 
emissions, so it’s vital to make it 
easier to opt for greener choices. Yet 
public transport provision continues 
to decline, often leaving those on low 
incomes with no affordable options. 
Greens MPs will champion better, 
cheaper public transport, so that 
every community is connected  
and can thrive.
We will push to:
•	 Increase annual public 
subsidies for rail and bus travel 
to £10bn by the end of the next 
Parliament, with free bus travel 
for under-18s.
•	 Invest in an additional £19bn 
over five years to improve 
public transport, support 
electrification and create new 
cycleways and footpaths.
•	 Bring the railways back into 
public ownership.
•	 Give local authorities control 
over and funding for improved 
bus services.
Safe streets and  
active travel
Walking, wheeling and cycling don’t 
just help reduce carbon emissions 
and air pollution – they can make us 
all happier and healthier too. 
Elected Greens will push for: 
•	 Investment of £2.5bn a year in 
new cycleways and footpaths.
•	 Reimagining how we use 
streets in residential areas to 
reduce traffic and open them 
up for community use.
•	 Adopting Active Travel 
England’s objective of 50% of 
trips in England’s towns and 
cities to be walked, wheeled or 
cycled by 2030.
Aviation
Aviation is the fastest-growing 
source of CO2 emissions, and it’s  
the wealthiest driving this trend. 
Green MPs will push for:
•	 A frequent-flyer levy.
•	 A ban on domestic flights for 
journeys that would take less 
than three hours by train.
•	 A halt to the expansion of new 
airport capacity.

FAIRER, GREENER TRANSPORT
Herefordshire:  
cheaper buses supporting 
local people and businesses
Green-led Herefordshire Council acted to revive the 
local economy and help small businesses after the Covid 
pandemic, by making all buses within the county free at 
the weekend and putting on extra weekend services. This 
popular change helped bring people into town centres, 
giving businesses a boost. The scheme lasted nearly a 
year and used £1 million of Covid recovery funding. Nearly 
170,000 journeys were taken and 12 new Sunday services 
laid on, giving great value for money. 
Council officers had suggested that the money be used 
to make car parking free, but the Green cabinet member 
for economy shifted the focus to buses to help meet the 
Council’s climate emergency commitments and support 
the many poorer households with no access to a car. 
After the scheme ended, the five most popular services 
have continued seven days a week, with most users now 
happy to pay for tickets. 
That’s the difference a Green in power can make!

A FAIRER, GREENER EDUCATION SYSTEM
A FAIRER, GREENER 
EDUCATION SYSTEM
Education should be about inspiring 
a love of learning and ensuring 
that every young person can 
reach their potential. Yet too many 
children are failing to thrive in an 
education system that operates 
like a production line rather than 
valuing their individual qualities. An 
investment in the next generation is 
the most important investment we 
can make.
Green MPs will champion:
•	 An increase in school funding of 
£8bn, to include £2bn for a pay 
uplift for teachers.
•	 Supporting every higher 
education student, with the 
restoration of grants and the 
end of tuition fees. 
•	 Ending high-stakes testing at 
primary and secondary schools 
and abolishing OFSTED.

Arts, sports and culture for all
Media
Our media landscape is skewed by 
the dominance of billionaire and big-
tech ownership, intent on maximising 
profits by irresponsible practices 
that undermine democracy and 
promote harmful online content.  
Elected Greens will push for: 
•	 A change in the law so that no 
single individual or company 
can own more than 20% of any 
media market. 
•	 All the reforms proposed in 
the second part of the 2012 
Leveson Report. 
Arts, sports and 
culture for all
Arts, culture and sports are 
central to people’s mental and 
physical wellbeing, and to thriving 
communities. They also make a huge 
contribution to the UK economy. 
Green MPs will push for:
•	 A £5bn investment to support 
community sports, arts and 
culture.
•	 Keeping local sports facilities, 
museums, theatres, libraries 
and art galleries open and 
thriving.
•	 An end to VAT on cultural 
activities, lowering the prices 
of everything from museum 
tickets to gigs in local pubs and 
making these more accessible.

DEFENDING HUMAN 
RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY 
and justice
•	 Replacing the first past the

elections with a fair and 
proportional voting system. 
•	 Replacing the House of Lords 
with an elected second 
chamber.
•	 Votes for 16-year-olds and 
residence-based voting rights.
Green MPs will always stand up 
against hate crime, misogyny and 
violence against women and girls, 
Islamophobia and antisemitism. 
Green MPs will always defend our 
democratic and human rights, uphold 
the rule of law and tackle political 
corruption. We will also push for the 
UK to become a modern, functional 
and more representative democracy. 
We will defend the Human Rights 
Act, the UK’s membership of the 
European Convention on Human 
Rights and continued direct access 
to Convention rights in the domestic 
courts.
Elected Greens will also push for:

DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY and justice
In 2023, Green councillor Mohamed 
Makawi, whose friend had been 
fatally stabbed in Castle Park, 
proposed a motion to bring down 
knife crime in Bristol that was 
passed by full Council. Rather than 
simply calling for more policing, the 
Green motion outlined practical 
solutions and addressed the social 
factors underlying knife violence. 
It introduced simple but vital steps 
to save lives, such as providing 
emergency bleed kits and staff 
training for night-time venues, and 
providing more lighting and CCTV 
to fix ‘blind spots’ in areas of high 
knife crime.   
Our commitment to human rights 
encompasses equalities, justice  
and civil liberties too. So we will: 
•	 Campaign to end violence 
against women and girls.
•	 Scrap the Police, Crime 
Sentencing and Courts Act, 
the Public Order Act and other 
legislation that erodes the right 
to protest and free expression.
•	 Campaign for the right of  
self-identification for trans  
and non-binary people.
•	 Scrap the Prevent programme 
and tackle hate crime, 
misogyny, Islamophobia  
and antisemitism. Seek to 
restore trust and confidence  
in the police.
•	 Repair and renew our  
crumbling court system  
with a £2.5bn investment.
Greens believe in national  
self-determination. Scotland, Wales 
and Northern Ireland should be free 
to make their own decisions about 
their relationship with the rest of the 
United Kingdom.

A FAIRER, GREENER WORLD
A FAIRER,  
GREENER WORLD
In a world threatened by war, 
climate breakdown and the rise of 
authoritarian regimes, the Green 
Party believes that the UK’s foreign 
policy should be based on shared 
commitments to democracy, peace, 
global solidarity and the protection 
of human rights. 
Green MPs will work for the UK to: 
•	 Take the lead in upholding the 
right to self-determination 
and the enforcement of 
international law. 
•	 Continue to support Ukraine as 
it resists Russian invasion.
•	 Re-join the EU as soon as the 
political conditions are right.
Israel and Palestine
We condemned the appalling murder 
of hundreds of Israeli civilians 
by Hamas, and since then have 
watched in horror as Israeli forces 
have committed war crimes that 
have caused the deaths of tens of 
thousands of Palestinian civilians.
Green MPs will push for:
•	 An immediate bilateral 
ceasefire.
•	 An end to arms sales to Israel.
•	 Redoubled efforts to secure 
the release of hostages taken 
on 7th October 2023.
•	 An urgent international effort  
to end the illegal occupation  
of Palestinian land.
•	 A durable political solution 
that ensures security and 
equal rights for Israelis and 
Palestinians
•	 The reinstatement of funding 
for UNRWA and support for 
South Africa’s submission to 
the International Court  
of Justice. 
Nuclear weapons  
and NATO
Most of the world’s countries do 
not possess weapons of mass 
destruction and are safer as a result. 
Elected Greens will: 
•	 Push for the UK to sign the 
UN Treaty on the Prohibition 
of Nuclear Weapons 
(TPNW) and following this to 
immediately begin the process 
of dismantling our nuclear 
40 green party: real hope. real CHANGE.
weapons, cancelling the Trident 
programme and removing all 
foreign nuclear weapons from 
UK soil.
•	 Work with international 
partners to enlarge 
membership of the TPNW and 
ensure that all states meet 
their commitments under 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty.
The Green Party recognises that 
NATO has an important role in 
ensuring the ability of its member 
states to respond to threats to their 
security. We would work within NATO 
to achieve:
•	 A greater focus on global 
peacebuilding.
•	 A commitment to a ‘No First 
Use’ of nuclear weapons. 
Climate diplomacy  
and overseas aid
In recognition of the importance 
of supporting countries in the 
Global South to decarbonise their 
economies and build resilience to 
increasingly severe storms, floods 
and extreme heat, Green MPs would 
push for the UK to:
•	 Increase international aid to 1% 
of gross national income (GNI) 
by 2033.
•	 Increase climate finance  
for the Global South to 1.5%  
of GNI by 2033, with an 
additional contribution to a 
newly established Loss and 
Damage Fund.

A fairer,

We welcome the contributions 
that migrants and refugees make 
to British society. We want to be

and support migrants to put down

environment.
•	 An end to the minimum income 
requirements for spouses of 
those holding work visas.
•	 Safe routes to sanctuary for 
those fleeing persecution.
•	 The dysfunctional Home 
Office to be replaced with a 
new Department of Migration, 
separating this function from 
the criminal justice system.
•	 An end to immigration 
detention for all migrants 
unless they are a danger to 
public safety.
•	 Abolition of the ‘no recourse 
to public funds’ condition that 
exacerbates social, economic, 
and racial inequalities.
•	 Those seeking asylum and 
protection to be permitted to 
work while their application is 
being decided.

VOTE HOPE.  
VOTE CHANGE.  
VOTE GREEN.
The Green Party has been going from 
strength to strength. When we tell  
the truth, aim high and offer hope, 
voters respond. 
We’ve increased our number of 
local authority councillors fivefold 
in the past five years and are now 
represented on 170 councils and part 
of the administration on 42.
Elected Green councillors use the 
power given to them by your votes  
to build fairer, greener communities. 
And that’s what elected Green MPs 
will do too.
In this election we are aiming high. 
We urgently need more Green MPs 
to put the climate emergency high 
on the national agenda, to resist 
and roll back the privatisation of 
public services, and to fight for 
the investment that’s desperately 
needed to mend so much that is 
broken and begin to create a fairer, 
greener country.
Now, it’s over to you. You can choose 
a fairer future for us all. Vote for real 
hope and real change. Vote Green.
