	•	How can we better co-ordinate care and support (indicate order of preference)?

	Have community or voluntary sector organisations, based locally, which act as a single point of contact. These organisations would advocate on behalf of the adult accessing care and support and communicate with the professionals involved in their care on their behalf when needed.
