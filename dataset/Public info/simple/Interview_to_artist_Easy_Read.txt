“In Portugal there’s an inclusive dance company
where people with and without disabilities
dance together”
“Dançando com a Diferença” is the name
of a dance company.
This is Portuguese.
It means “Dancing with a difference”.
This dance company is inclusive.
Inclusive means that
people without disabilities
and people with disabilities
work there together.
The company is well-known
in countries such as
Portugal and Brazil.
We talked to the founder and director
of the dance company,
Henrique Amoedo.
How did you get the idea
to start an inclusive dance company?
When I was younger,
I was studying at the university in Portugal.
I also worked at a place
where people created
inclusive forms of art.
There, I was giving some dance lessons
to people with disabilities.
Then I started a bigger dance project.
That was in 1994.
Some of the participants of this bigger project
later on joined my dance company
“Dancing with a difference”.
We have done shows
created for us
by famous Portuguese dancers.
We also want to make
inclusive dance
more known among people.
We people to understand
that persons with disabilities can dance
and put on beautiful shows.
What support do go get
for the inclusive dance company?
We get some money from the
government
of Portugal,
and also from regional and local governments.
Families of the dancers
and other people
have helped us, too.
A lot of people trust us and
like our work,
because we are a safe place
where people with and without disabilities
can learn to dance.
Our dancers need more time than other people
to prepare the shows.
Sometimes people do not understand this
and think we are wasting time.
This is why some offices
don’t want to give us money.
I think that is wrong.
Our work is very important.
How did you choose the dancers in your company?
We did not choose them
the same way as other dance companies.
Everybody can take part in our activities,
people with and without disabilities.
Some of the people
become also part of the group that make the show.
We look at how a person dances
and see if they fit well into the group.
In our dance company
there are people
from different countries.
How long does it take
to prepare a dance show?
How many times a week
do the dancers train?
Most of the times,
it takes 1 or 2 months
to prepare a new show.
The number of dancers
can change.
If there are a lot of dancers in the show,
it is harder to put on the show
in different cities.
Then we do not always work with the same dancers,
but with different dancers in different cities.
How do the dancers practice for a new show?
It is like everywhere else.
The dancers need to get to know their own body.
Then they can find out what they can do with it.
What is your favourite piece?
I do not have a favourite piece.
But this is our goal:
our shows are made to change peoples’ ideas
about people with disabilities.
We want them to understand
what people with disabilities can do.
I think that there is a way to reach this goal:
we need to use feelings.
I want our shows to make the people
who come to watch us
feel something.
For example, joy, happiness,
or also fear or anger.
When they feel something,
it makes it easier for them
to change their minds
about people with disabilities.
What are your plans?
We are now working on a
new play called “Happy Island”.
It will involve a lot of dancing and moving.
I hope that many new people
will come to see this new show.
I would like to build up a training programme
for professionals.
In this way, other people will be able
to also teach inclusive dance.
We need to work a lot
so people will know about us.
To continue our work,
we need to look for new people
who are interested in what we do.
Our work brings the voice of people with intellectual disabilities and their families where decisions about their future are made.
This has always been incredibly important. It is even more so with the Covid pandemic drastic impact on their rights and lives.
Being visible and vocal on issues directly affecting millions of people requires your support.
