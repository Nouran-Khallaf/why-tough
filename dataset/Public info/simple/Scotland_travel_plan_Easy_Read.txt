What is this document about? 
 
 
This paper shows the work that has 
been done on the Accessible Travel 
Framework in 2019 and 2020. 
 
 
 
The Framework is a 10 year plan to 
make public transport better for 
disabled people.  
 
 
 
This paper will give an update on the 8 
main projects that Transport Scotland 
are working on to make the Framework 
happen. 
 
A word from the Minister 
 
 
Michael Matheson is the Minister in 
charge of transport.  
Mr Matheson is happy with the 
progress of the projects including: 
• The Thistle Assistance Card 
• The Hate Crime Charter pilot 
• Passenger Assistance on rail and 
ferries

Mr Matheson thanks MACS, Disability 
Equality Scotland, the Accessible 
Travel Steering Group and SEStran for 
their hard work. 
 
 
How transport can help with coronavirus. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Transport Scotland have written a 
Transport Transition Plan. 
It gives information on how to keep 
transport safe during coronavirus.   
 
 
The Transport Transition Plan 
Equalities Network are a group of 
organisations who help with the plan. 
Many groups gave information to help 
with the plan.   
Disabled people’s views were included 
in the plan.  
 
 
A national Advisory Group was set up. 
The Mobility and Access Committee 
(MACS) have people on this group to 
speak about the views of disabled 
people.  
4 
 
 
The Accessible Travel Policy Steering 
Group is made up of different disabled 
groups.  
They made sure that information from 
people with different types of disability 
was included in the plan.  
  
 
 
Disability Equality Scotland is a national 
disabled person’s organisation.   
It held webinars and surveys to get the 
views of disabled people and added 
these to the plan. 
 
 
 
MACS give advice to Scottish 
Government Ministers.   
MACS wrote guidance for transport 
operators to help disabled passengers. 
 
 
 
Other organisations like Guide Dogs 
UK, RNIB and Future Journeys 
Observatory also gave their views to 
help with the plan.

Projects for 2019-20 
 
 
 
 
 
Coronavirus meant that some projects 
had to stop but lots of work kept going. 
8 projects were worked on.   
This paper will now talk about each 
project and the work they have done.  
 
Project 1 - Passenger Assistance 
 
 
ScotRail continued to offer passenger 
assistance at a safe distance.   
In 2021 someone will be able to book 
passenger assistance an hour before 
they need to travel.   
 
 
ScotRail use an app that means staff 
can communicate with deaf passengers 
who use British Sign Language to 
communicate. 
 
 
Northlink Ferries introduced Ramble 
Tags so they could still give assistance 
to passengers without any direct 
physical contact. 
 
 
 
The Thistle Assistance Card now has a 
message about face covering 
exemptions.

Project 2 - Travel by aeroplane 
 
 
 
Not many people used air travel during 
the coronavirus pandemic. 
 
 
 
Inverness airport won awards at the 
Scottish Transport Awards and from 
Nairn Access Panel for good 
accessibility. 
The airport got a high rating for 
customer service.   
 
 
 
Inverness also has accessibility guides 
on their website and new ramps to 
make it easy for wheelchairs to get on 
the aeroplane. 
 
 
Project 3 - Travel by Bus 
 
 
There is a plan to get more people to 
use the bus and leave cars at home. 
This will be better for the environment. 
7 
 
 
The UK Government want to put audio 
and visual information on buses and 
coaches to help disabled people.   
In Scotland, some new buses have this 
information. 
All buses should have the information. 
 
 
The Scottish Government is looking to 
give free bus travel to all people aged 
under 19. 
 
 
 
Project 4 - Signs, finding your way and information 
 
 
In Aberdeen, there are new signs to 
help you get from the train station to 
the Northlink ferry.  
 
 
 
 
Northlink ferries designed new floor 
signs about keeping your distance 
when queuing. 
 
8 
 
 Project 5 - Thistle Assistance 
 
Thistle Assistance is a card and mobile 
phone app.   
People can show their card to transport 
staff to let them know they need some 
support.  
 
There was a new website and social 
media to tell people about the Thistle 
Assistance card and app.   
20 thousand free cards have been 
given out in Scotland.  
 
Project 6 - Clear pathways  
 
The Scottish Government is working 
with local authorities to ban people 
from parking on pavements.  
This project also looked at inclusive 
design of town centres and streets.   
Disabled people are involved in giving 
their views on the design of streets. 
 
Project 7 - Taxi and private hire cars  
 
 
 
Most taxis are not wheelchair 
accessible. 
Research says that this is getting 
better. 
9 
 
 
 
The Scottish Government will be 
publishing new guidance about 
accessibility for taxis. 
 
 
Project 8 - Hate Crime  
 
This project is about a Hate Crime 
Charter.                                                                  
A Charter is like a poster.  
It tells people that the transport 
operator will not put up with hate crime 
and will report it if it happens on their 
service. 
 
 
 
The Hate Crime Charter was started in 
December 2019.   
It was tried first with Stagecoach, 
FirstBus and ScotRail. 
 
1.2 million people saw the Charter and 
it has helped raise awareness of hate 
crime.  
 
 
Disability Equality Scotland worked on 
this Charter.                                                          
They also did work with CalMac Ferries 
to put similar guidance in place on the 
ferry.

What happens next? 
 
 
The Scottish Government will take 
action in 5 areas. 
• A list of priority projects that will be 
agreed with disabled people. 
   
 
• A description of the barriers to 
making journeys. 
 
• Evidence that shows what its 
really like to make journeys. 
 
 
• An online document that people 
can comment on. 
 
• An online community where 
people can talk about these 
projects. 
 
 
Coronavirus has made things more 
difficult in 2020.   
The Scottish Government still work to 
make sure disabled people can travel in 
the same ways as everyone else.
