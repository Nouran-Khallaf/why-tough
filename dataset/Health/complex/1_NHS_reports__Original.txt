Key facts  
Children and Families 
• Children receiving social services can be aged from 0 (or pre-birth) to 18. For 
some young people who have been looked after by a local authority, a social 
work or social worker-led service may continue up to the age of 26. 
• The reasons why social work involvement may be necessary vary, but usually the 
parents, children and/or whole family will be experiencing a combination of 
practical, emotional, and relationship difficulties.  
• Children and parents in all income groups and with a wide range of disabilities, 
emotional and relationship difficulties may be assessed as in need of a social 
work service. However, families from areas of higher deprivation are more likely 
to receive statutory social work services.  
Child Protection  
• During 2021, 570 Child Protection Orders were granted in emergency/high risk 
situations, with more orders granted for very young children. 
• 4,397 initial and pre-birth Case Conferences were held – 76% of which resulted 
in a registration to the Child Protection Register.  
• As at 31 July 2021, 2,104 children were on the Child Protection Register – the 
lowest this figure has been since 2002. 
Looked after children  
• As at 31 July 2021, 13,255 children were looked after – the lowest this figure has 
been since 2006. 
• The most common types of placements for looked after children were: at home 
with parents, kinship care, and with foster carers. 
Workforce 
• In 2020, the overall headcount for children’s social services was 15,830 – a 5% 
increase since 2015.  
• The two largest subsectors in children’s social services were residential child 
care (55%) and fieldwork services (37%).

Introduction  
This paper provides an overview of social services1 provided to children and families 
in Scotland. 2 It forms one of an initial collection of contextual papers, setting out key 
sources of information about social care and related areas in Scotland, linking to the 
National Care Service Consultation proposals published in August 2021. Information 
on key national trends in those services is also provided. This includes provision 
trends, population profiles of children to whom these services are provided, and the 
workforce.  
Official and National statistics are available for: 
• Child Protection  
• Children’s Hearings Duties (including the Principal Reporter)  
• Looked after children 
• Secure Care Accommodation 
This is one of a collection of papers produced to inform draft legislation for the NCS. 
The collection consists of the following 6 papers on adult social care: 
1. Scotland’s Health and Demographic Profile 
2. People who Access Social Care and Unpaid Carers in Scotland 
3. Social Care Support and Service Provision in Scotland 
4. Experiences of Social Care and Caring in Scotland

1 “Social services” is a term used to describe social work and social care services: 
• 
Social work is a statutory role undertaken by qualified and registered social workers.  Its role is to 
assess need, manage risk and promote the wellbeing of individuals and communities. It is the 
gateway through which most individuals access social care. 
• 
Social care is an umbrella term for services which support people to meet their personal 
outcomes. It is the direct provision of services based on the assessment of need by social work. 
2 Services not covered by this report are: health services, additional support services, other youth 
justice services and whole family support services.

1.2 Context 
Social services are provided to children and their families when additional support is 
needed or when children are at risk.  
Section 22 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 places a duty on local authorities to 
safeguard and promote the welfare of children in their area who are in need and, 
where consistent with that duty, to promote the upbringing of children within their 
families. Every local authority in Scotland provides social services to fulfil these 
statutory duties.  
Social work services may become involved with a family through different routes. A 
family member may request a social work service. It is more common that they will 
be referred by someone they know, usually a professional such as a health visitor, 
doctor, teacher, youth worker, or community police officer. This will usually be done 
with the person’s permission. Anyone who considers that a child is being harmed or 
is at risk of suffering harm (usually a professional such as those above) may refer 
the child for assessment of whether a formal child protection service is necessary. 
Exceptionally, this can be done without seeking the parents' or an older child's

agreement, though professionals will usually try to explain why they consider that 
this is necessary and the steps a social worker might take. 
Children and young people receiving social work services can be aged from 0 (or 
even pre-birth) to 18 years. If a young person has been looked after by the local 
authority, a social work or social worker-led service may continue up to the age of 
26.  
 
The reasons why social work involvement may be necessary are very varied but 
usually the parents and/or children, or the whole family, may be experiencing a 
combination of practical, emotional and relationship difficulties. Children and parents 
in all income groups and with a wide range of disabilities, emotional and relationship 
difficulties may be assessed as in need of a social work service. However, families 
from areas of higher deprivation are more likely to receive statutory social work 
services and poverty has a pervasive impact on families.

Child Protection 
Child Protection refers to a range of processes involved in considering, assessing, 
planning, and taking necessary action to protect a child from abuse or neglect. 
These processes are usually initiated when a concern about harm or risk of harm to 
a child has been raised, and police and/or social work have been notified.  If there is 
likelihood of significant harm, an inter-agency discussion3 will commence – the 
formal process of information sharing, assessment, analysis, and decision-making 
following reported concern. 
If the likelihood of significant harm to the child or others is present, initial plans are 
made about: investigation; joint investigative interviews; health assessment; the 
needs of the child and others involved in this context; as well as any immediate 
protective action.  
2.1 Inter-agency referral discussions 
An inter-agency referral discussion (IRD) is the start of the formal process of 
information sharing, assessment, analysis and decision-making following reported 
concern about abuse or neglect of a child or young person up to the age of 18 years, 
in relation to familial and non-familial concerns, and of siblings or other children 
within the same context. This includes an unborn baby that may be exposed to 
current or future risk.  
An IRD involves significant system interrogation, analysis and multi-agency decision 
making by the three core agencies; Social Work, Police, and Health. It also places a 
requirement on social work to seek the views of education colleagues and any other 
relevant agencies. Seeking views from the child (where possible) and their main care 
givers is central to this process. 
Currently there are no published Official Statistics relating to IRD due to historical 
variation in the approach to IRD across Scotland, both in definition and in practice. 
National Guidance for Child Protection4, revised and published in 2021, outlines how 
statutory and non-government agencies should work together with parents, families 
and communities to prevent harm and to protect children from abuse and neglect, 
including in relation to IRD. Therefore, future statistical data collection is intended to 
include IRD numbers to reflect child protection activity across Scotland. 
                                             
3 The Scottish Government have been monitoring the number of Inter-Agency Discussions as part of 
the  Vulnerable Children COVID19 Monitoring Survey. These figures are not subject to the same 
quality assurance controls as Official Statistics and are therefore not presented here.

protection in Scotland 2021.

2.2 Child Protection Investigation 
A Child Protection Investigation is a multi-agency assessment which takes places 
when inter-agency discussions decide that the child is at risk of significant harm5. 
This enables core agencies (e.g. police and social work) to gather information to 
inform risk assessment and needs of the child, as well as need for protective action. 
In 2021, 11,726 Child Protection Investigations took place (rate of 12.8 per 1,000 of 
child population6).  
2.3 Child Protection Case Conference 
If, following an investigation, a child is deemed to be at risk of significant harm a 
case conference7 will be held. This is a formal multi-disciplinary meeting during 
which core agency professionals and the family of the child will share information, 
identify risks and outline what action needs to be taken to protect the child (e.g. 
decide whether a child should be registered on the Child Protection Register, and 
whether referral to the Reporter is necessary for consideration of compulsory 
supervision measures).  
In 2021, 4,397 initial8 and pre-birth9 case conferences were held. The most common 
concerns identified at these case conferences are set out in Chart 1. 
 
 
                                             
5 If not, assessment and support may still be offered.

7 Please note changes in terminology set out by the National Guidance for Child Protection in 
Scotland 2021 – from ‘Child Protection Case Conferences’ to ‘Child Protection Planning Meetings’. 
Here we refer to ‘Case Conferences’ to reflect terminology used within the most recent Children’s 
Social Work Statistics publication.  
8 Initial conference is for a child not currently on the Register (i.e., newly registered). 
9 Pre-birth conferences are for an unborn child.

2.4 Child Protection Orders (CPO) 
A CPO is sought in emergency and high risk situations, where protection measures 
need to be put in place immediately to protect the child. Applications for CPOs are 
made in the Sheriff Court. A CPO may grant authority for a child to be removed from 
home to a safe place, or prevent the removal of the child from a place of safety. If 
granted by a Sheriff, a CPO leads to a referral to the Reporter and consideration of 
compulsory measures of supervision.   
In 2021, 570 CPOs were granted. Of these, 99 (17%) related to children under the 
age of 20 days, 210 (37%) children under 1 year old, and 249 (44%) children under 2 
years old (Chart 2). A significant proportion of CPOs are granted for very young 
children reflecting their high vulnerability and need for immediate protection.

2.5 New registrations on the Child Protection Register 
If a case conference concludes significant risk of harm is present, the child will be 
added to the Child Protection Register.  
In 2021, 3,324 (76%) of all initial and pre-birth case conferences resulted in a 
registration.  
2.6 Children on the Child Protection Register 
As at 31 July 2021, 2,104 children were on the Register (rate of 2.3 per 1,000 of 
child population10) – the lowest this figure has been since 2002. Over the past 
decade, the number of children on the Register has fluctuated (Chart 3).

The Children’s Hearings System 
The Children’s Hearings system is Scotland’s care and justice system for children 
and young people. It exists to protect the safety and wellbeing of infants, children 
and young people across Scotland. The Scottish Children’s Reporter Administration  
and Children’s Hearings Scotland are key statutory organisations within this system. 
It is not proposed that either of these organisations are within the scope of the NCS. 
Their independence, and that of the Reporter, are key components to the system. 
The system plays a critical role in the social services provided to children through the 
decision-making functions.

Children’s Hearings Duties 
Children are referred to the Children’s Reporter if it is considered that they may need 
compulsory legal measures of protection, guidance, treatment or control. Most 
referrals to the Children’s Reporter come from partner agencies, such as the police, 
social work, and education. Additionally, parents, family members, carers or 
members of the public can make a referral. The Reporter will investigate the referral 
and decide whether or not to convene a Children’s Hearing – the legal tribunal 
responsible for deciding what’s in the best interest of the child and whether 
compulsory measures of supervision are necessary and, if so, which ones. 
4.1 Children referred to the Reporter 
In 2021, 9,665 children were referred11 to the Reporter, equating to 1.1% of all 
children in Scotland12. Of these, 8,013 were referred on care and protection (non-
offence) grounds and 2,207 on offence grounds. 
Over the past decade, the number of children referred to the Reporter has declined 
(Chart 5), peaking in 2011 and at its lowest in 2021.

years, with the exception of ‘offence grounds’ which is shown per 1,000 of population aged between 8 
and 16 years. 
Notably, in 2021: 
• Most children were referred by Police (68%) and Social Work (29%). 
• The most common grounds for referrals were: 
1. Lack of parental care (3,449) 
2. Offence (2,198) 
3. Close connection with person who has carried out domestic abuse 
(1,961) 
4. Child’s conduct harmful to self or others (946). 
• 22% of children (2,150) with cases decided had a Reporter decision to 
arrange a Children’s Hearing on at least one referral.  
 
 
  
 
15 
 
4.2 Children’s Hearings 
In 2021, 16,248 Children’s Hearings were held for 8,977 children (rate of 17.7 per 
1,000 population13) –  a decrease from 41,825 Hearing held in 2011 (rate of 45.6 per 
1,000 population). A concerted effort to reduce referrals where there was no need for 
compulsory measures has brought referrals numbers down in recent years.  
Following assessment and development of a multiagency child plan, social workers 
will prepare reports for a Children’s Hearing. The purpose of this is to enable the 
Hearing (made up of a panel of three members) to make an informed decision about 
the best interests of the child and provide effective outcomes that support the child 
and their family. This includes addressing assessed needs, promote the child’s 
welfare and, where the referral concerns offending, reduce any risks of reoffending. 
The Hearing will decide if compulsory measures of supervision are required as being 
in the best interests of the child or young person and, if so, what those should be. If 
the hearing concludes compulsory measures of supervision are needed, it will make 
a Compulsory Supervision Order (CSO) which will identify the measures required.  In 
most cases the child will continue to live at home but will be under the supervision of 
the Chief Social Worker. In some cases the hearing will decide that the child should 
live away from home with relatives or other carers, or in an identified residential 
placement (see next section on looked after children). 
4.3 Compulsory Supervision Orders (CSO)  
In 2021, 7,959 children (0.9% of Scotland’s child population) were subject to a CSO 
(rate of 8.7 per 1,000 population14), compared with 13,474 in 2011 (rate of 14.7 per 
1,000 population).    
4.4 Demographic profiles of children referred to the Reporter 
In 2021, 57% of children referred to the Reporter were male and 43% were female. A 
large number of children were referred before their first birthday (769). Referral rates 
then remain relatively consistent before increasing from ages 12 (618) and to 15 
years (1,296).

Looked after children  
Under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, looked after children are those in the care of 
their local authority. Children can be looked after and live at home if they are subject 
to a CSO. Where children and young people are looked after away from home, this 
can be where the child: 
• 
has been through the Children's Hearings system and is subject to a CSO with a 
condition of residence; 
• 
is subject to an order made or authorisation or warrant granted by virtue of 
chapter 2, 3 or 4 of Part 2 of the 1995 Act; 
• 
is being provided with accommodation under Section 25 of the 1995 Act (a 
voluntary agreement); 
• 
is placed by a local authority which has made a permanence order under section 
80 of the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007. 
There are many reasons children may become looked after, including: 
• 
they face abuse or neglect at home; 
• 
they have disabilities that require special care; 
• 
they are unaccompanied minors seeking asylum, or who have been illegally 
trafficked into the UK; 
• 
they have been involved in the youth justice system. 
Children may be looked after for a short time, longer time, or it could be episodic – 
there are a range of different circumstances. Children who are looked after away 
from home may be placed with kinship carers (extended family/friends), foster 
carers, with prospective adopters, or in residential care (see next section on types of 
placements).  
As at 31 July 2021, 13,255 children were looked after, reflecting 1.3% of Scotland’s 
child population15 and the lowest this figure has been since 2006. Of these, 95% had 
a current care plan16 produced by the local authority.  
Over the past decade, the number of looked after children in Scotland has declined 
(Chart 7), peaking in 2012 and was at its lowest in 2021.  
                                             
15 % of population aged under 18 years, based on mid-year estimates for 2020 from the National 
Records of Scotland. 
16A care plan includes detailed information about the child’s care, education and health needs, as well 
as the responsibilities of the local authority, the parents, and the child. A care plan is considered 
‘current’ if it has been produced or reviewed in the past 12 months.

5.1 Types of placements 
At home with parents: A child becomes looked after at home when the  
Children's Hearing imposes a supervision requirement with no condition  
of residence. There are two main instances in which this happens: 
• as a starting point for planned intervention, where the balance of risk  
 
indicates that it is not essential to remove the child from the care of their  
 
parents, but that the situation must be monitored; 
• where children are returning home after being looked after away from  
 
home, where some risks still remain and home supervision aims to help  
 
reunite the family. 
A child looked after at home continues to live at their usual residence (usually  
the family home), but receives regular visits from social workers to ensure that  
the objectives of the home supervision order are being met. In 2021, 2,859 children 
were placed at home with parents (22% of all looked after children). 
Kinship care: when a child is looked after by their extended family or close friends if 
they cannot remain with their birth parents. Under the Looked after children 
(Scotland) Regulations 2009, a kinship carer is defined as: "a person who is related 
to the child (through blood, marriage or civil partnership) or a person with whom the 
child has a pre-existing relationship". In 2021, 4,399 children were placed in kinship 
care (33% of all looked after children). 
 
 
  
 
19 
 
Foster care: when a child is looked after by an approved foster family in their home. 
Fostering can be provided for short breaks or to provide interim, long term or 
permanent care for children. In 2021, 3,160 children were placed with foster carers 
provided by a local authority and 1,307 children were placed with foster carers 
purchased by a local authority (24% and 10% of all looked after children, 
respectively). In 2020, there were 59 fostering services in Scotland, with 27 
independent services in addition to 32 local authority services and a total of 3,540 
approved foster care households. 
Prospective adopters: when a child is placed with their prospective adopters. In 
2021, 156 children were placed with prospective adopters (1% of all looked after 
children).  
Residential child care: Residential care homes provide accommodation, support 
and, in some cases, education for young people, usually of secondary school age. In 
2021, 1,286 children were placed in a residential placement (10% of all looked after 
children). In 2020, residential child care provision included 323 care homes for 
children, 5 secure care centres, and 37 residential special schools. 
In 2021, most looked after children (90%) were placed in the community (Table 3). 
Notably, while the proportion of children placed at home with parents decreased over 
the past decade (from 34% in 2011 to 22% in 2021), the proportion of children 
placed with kinship carers increased (from 24% in 2011 to 33% in 2021).

In terms of the number of placements provided for children who are looked after, the 
pattern has remained relatively stable since 2012 (Chart 8). Notably, since 2012 the 
proportion of children with 3 or more placements has decreased slightly from 6% to 
4% in 2021. By contrast, the proportion of children with a single placement has 
increased from 80% in 2012 to 83% in 2021.

5.2 Social services support for looked after children 
When children and young people are looked after, social services will provide 
support in various ways and carry out a number of functions. This includes: 
• Supporting children and families who voluntarily reach accommodation 
agreements and support the family to keep the child safe and nurtured in a 
placement out with the usual family home. 
• Recruitment and assessment of prospective foster carers and adopters; and the 
identification and assessment of potential kinship carers for children who require 
care away from home. The conversion rate from initial enquiry to approval and 
registration as a foster carer is one in twelve. Thereafter supporting children, 
carers and/or parents, even following a permanency decision, to prevent 
 
 
  
 
23 
 
breakdown of family relationships and further supporting the child or young 
person to maintain sibling type relationships where appropriate. 
• Supporting children and young people to maintain meaningful relationships with 
the people that they identify as important to them. This may include tracing ‘lost’ 
family relationships and facilitating family meetings. Additionally, helping children 
and young people, even following their experience of care, to find and connect 
with key people and supporting their understanding of their life story.  
5.3 Children ceasing to be looked after 
In 2021, substantially more children ceased to be looked after, than started to 
become looked after. By contrast, in 2011 slightly more children started to become 
looked after than ceased (Chart 10).  
Chart 10. Number of children starting and ceasing to be looked after at 31 July, 
2011-2021
 
Compared with 2011, a higher proportion of children ceasing to be looked after had 
been looked after for five years or longer – up from 13% in 2011 to 21% in 2021. 
Meanwhile the proportion of children looked after for a shorter period of time, 
 
 
  
 
24 
 
especially for between 6 months and under 1 year, decreased (from 16% in 2011 to 
10% 2021).  
In terms of the recorded destinations of children ceasing to be looked after in 2021 
(Table 6):  
• 56% had a recorded destination of at home with their biological parents – a 4 
percentage point decrease since 2011 (60%); 
• 16% had a recorded destination of kinship care – a 3 percentage point increase 
since 2011 (13%); 
• 6% of children were adopted – a figure which has remained stable since 2011. 
The majority of children who were adopted (66%) were below the age of 5 years.

[1] This excludes planned series of short term placements. A child may cease to be looked after more 
than once during the year and will be counted once for each episode of care ending.  
[2] New destination categories of 'Continuing Care' and 'Kinship Care Order' were added in 2018. 
Previously, children who left care for 'Continuing Care' were mostly recorded in the ‘Foster Carers’ 
destination category, while those whole left care under a 'Kinship Care Order' were mostly recorded in 
the ‘Kinship Carers (friends/relatives)’ category. 
[3] ‘Other’ includes residential care, homeless, in custody and other destination.

5.4 Support for care leavers  
5.4.1 Pathway planning 
It is expected that all young people who are looked after on their 16th birthday will 
have had a pathway assessment, and will have a pathway plan in place as to their 
future before they cease to be looked after. This will set out the actions that must be 
taken by the local authority, the young person, their parents, their carers, and other 
agencies to enable them to achieve their aspirations and make a successful 
 
 
  
 
25 
 
transition to adulthood. In 2021, 71% of eligible young people had a pathway plan. 
Further, 56% of eligible young people had a pathway co-ordinator (Table 7).

person may be counted more than once). 
[2] It may be the case that some young people who don't have a relevant pathway plan/coordinator 
may be receiving similar support from adult services instead. 
5.4.2 Continuing care 
Young people aged 16 years or over who are looked after in foster, kinship, or 
residential care are eligible to remain in their current care placement until the age of 
21 – also known as Continuing Care17. In 2021, 534 young people were in 
Continuing Care. 
5.4.3 Aftercare  
Aftercare services18 refer to local authorities’ duty to provide advice, guidance, and 
assistance for all care leavers who cease to be looked after on or after their 16th 
birthday, and are below 26 years of age. This provision applies to all care leavers 
regardless of the placement type while looked after. Social services provide this 
support for young people who have experienced care and who are moving on to 
independence. In 2021, 54% of young people eligible for aftercare support were in 
receipt of aftercare services (Table 8).  
 
 
                                             
17 A young person receiving Continuing Care will no longer be defined as 'looked after' but will 
continue to receive the same support. 
18 Since April 2015, aftercare eligibility was extended to cover all care leavers up to, and including, 
people aged 25 years (where it previously only covered up to their 21st birthday).

Adoption services  
An adoption service makes arrangements in connection with the adoption of 
children. This does not include when the proposed adopter is a relative of the child. 
There were 38 adoption services operating in Scotland in 2020, 32 local authority 
adoption services and six independent adoption services. In 2020, 232 new adoptive 
households were approved, down from 259 in 2019 and continuing a downward 
trend. The year-on-year decrease is only in the local authority sector, with 
independent services showing a flatter trend. There were 186 approved households 
at 31 December 2020 waiting for a child to be placed. At the same time there were 
148 children and young people approved for adoption and waiting to be matched to 
an adoptive household. Of these, 47% were part of a family group (an increase from 
31% the previous year) and 30% had been waiting for over one year. In 2020 there 
were 225 children approved for adoption, 207 children placed with their new adoptive 
families and 206 children legally adopted.

 Secure Care Accommodation  
Secure care accommodation is a locked residential care setting that provides 
intensive trauma-informed support, care, and education to children aged 12-18 years 
who may be a significant risk to themselves or others in the community. A secure 
care placement can only be authorised following a decision through the Children’s 
Hearing system, court, or as an emergency placement for a looked after child for up 
to 72 hours before attending a Hearing or court. 
7.1 Capacity 
In Scotland there are five secure care accommodation units in total. As at 31 July 
2021, there were 84 beds available in five secure units (of which, one is a local 
authority run setting and four are independent) in Scotland, compared with 90 beds 
in 2014. In 2021, the annual average number of residents was 76, compared with 74 
in 2014.   
7.2 Admissions  
In 2021, 177 young people were admitted to secure care accommodation (rate of 
0.31 per 1,000), compared with 232 young people in 2014 (rate of 0.39 per 1,000; 
Chart 11). Admissions may include young people who are from elsewhere in the UK. 
Chart 11. Rate per 1,000 of young people admitted to Secure Care, 2014-2021 
[1] Rate per 1,000 is calculated using relevant NRS mid-year population estimates for those aged 10-

[2] Young people can be admitted more than once during the year.

7.3 Demographic profiles of residents 
In 2021, 56% of residents were male and 44% were female. The highest proportion 
were over the age of 15 (72%; Chart 12). 
Chart 12. Age of residents,  at 31 July 2021 
 
In 2021, 23% of residents had a disabilty19, while the remaining 77% either did not

Other welfare and support services  
The needs of children and families supported by social services differ widely and do 
not always require the statutory approaches available in child protection procedures 
or the children’s hearing system. Some have needs which can be addressed simply 
and swiftly through appropriate interventions and support. Other children and 
families may require longer term and intensive support for complex and long-lasting 
needs.   
Children who are at risk of becoming looked after or being placed into residential 
care may need support to remain with their families in a manner that is safe, 
nurturing and which promotes their welfare. Social services are significantly involved 
in multi-agency whole system and Getting It Right For Every Child20 (GIRFEC) 
approaches. These include early and effective interventions which support the child 
                                             
19 This is defined as having a mental or physical impairment which has a substantial and long-term 
adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. 
20 GIRFEC is the national approach which supports families by making sure children and young 
people can receive the right help, at the right time, from the right people. The aim is to help them to 
grow up feeling loved, safe and respected so that they can realise their full potential. If children need 
extra help, GIRFEC is a way for families to work in partnership with people who can support them.

and their family (where child welfare concerns emerge) to avoid crises, reduce the 
risks of offending behaviours by the child and prevent the need further down the line 
for statutory interventions or for children to become looked after. This will involve 
working within a multidisciplinary forum for children who are neither categorised as 
“looked after” children nor placed on the child protection register. Social workers will 
attend meetings with universal services (such as education and certain healthcare 
services) where a child wellbeing concern has been identified. This will happen 
under the GIRFEC framework which ensures that support for the child, from the right 
people, is put in place at the most appropriate time through a single planning 
process that may result in a single child’s plan coordinated by a Lead Professional. 
Referrals may also be made for children, young people, and families to targeted 
services provided by third and independent sector organisations which play an 
important role in improving outcomes for children and families. Services may include 
befriending, mentoring, outreach, and intensive family support. Delivery of the whole 
system and GIRFEC approaches have contributed to the downward trends in recent 
years of children who are referred to the children’s reporter, and for the length of 
time that children remain on child protection registers. 
In order to avoid bringing children into the criminal justice system, social services 
support diversion from prosecution. This may include offence and behaviour focused 
work through addressing the needs of children and young people who have offended 
and/or who are at risk of doing so. This is often carried out either by children and 
families social work, youth justice social work or criminal justice teams and provides 
early and effective interventions and diversions from the courts and the children’s 
hearings system whilst also reducing the risks of (re)offending. Other interventions 
include diversion programmes.  
The services provided under section 22 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 local 
authority duty includes services for disabled children under the age of 18, children 
affected adversely by the disability of any other person in the family, and children 
whose health or development may be affected or may fall below a reasonable 
standard without services from the local authority. Social work services will often 
route the child and their family to other professional services such as speech and 
language therapy, psychology, addictions and a range of healthcare provision. 
The Social Care (Self-Directed Support) Act 2013 affects the way that particular 
forms of support for children and families are arranged and provided to children and 
families. In particular, it provides the opportunity for children and families to take 
greater control over the support provided to them. The 2013 Act imposes a further 
duty to provide choice and flexibility with respect to the relevant support to children 
or families.  It requires the local authority to provide a range of options to the 
child/family. In a great number of circumstances (including all support to children 
affected by disability but not restricted to such support) the provision of alternatives 
 
 
  
 
30 
 
such as direct payments or individual services funds can provide a creative and 
positive means by which to meet the child's needs. However, in some instances the 
local authority's safeguarding function will affect the form of support which is 
necessary to safeguard the child's wellbeing, and therefore the extent to which 
additional choice and control is possible.

Workforce 
This section relates to the workforce involved in the processes described above, 
using SSSC sources. Where possible, the most recent available data is reported.   
9.1 Headcount and composition  
In 2020, the overall headcount for children’s social services was 15,830 – a 5% 
increase since 2015 (Table 10). The two largest subsectors in children’s social 
services were residential child care21 (accounting for 55% of the total headcount), 
and fieldwork services22 (accounting for 37% of the total headcount). The Public 
Service Reform Scotland Act 2010 distinguishes between registered care services 
on one hand, and social work services (of which fieldwork services are the essential 
part) on the other. 
Since 2015, the greatest percentage increase in headcount was observed in 
residential childcare (+13%). Meanwhile, the greatest percentage decrease was 
observed for fostering services (-14%).

accommodation services for children who are looked after away from home. 
22 Local authority fieldwork staff usually based in local offices providing services to children and 
families. Staff will include qualified social workers. The Public Service Reform Scotland Act 2010 
distinguishes between registered care services on one hand, and social work services (of which 
fieldwork services are the essential part) on the other.

9.4 Fieldwork Services 
This section draws from Local authority post types tables published by the SSSC, 
the most recent of which relates to 2020 (as at first Monday in December). Please 
note that these figures are different from those reported for 2019 as these relate to 
different published data and time periods. 
This data includes all filled posts in local authority social work services where those 
employed do not work in a registered care service. This therefore covers staff 
working primarily in fieldwork social work services.  
In 2020, 5,916 staff worked in fieldwork social work services. The majority of this 
workforce were female (85%). 
9.4.1 Post characteristics 
The majority (70%) of staff in fieldwork social work services worked in a full time 
post. In terms of job function, 39% of the fieldwork services work force constituted 
main grade social workers and 17% included social work assistants. Proportions of 
other roles are summarised in Table 18.

10 Conclusion 
This report provides an overview of social services provided to children and families 
in Scotland. This report should be considered in light of its limitations and that only 
readily available data was used. Therefore, further analysis may be necessary on the 
delivery of children’s services.
