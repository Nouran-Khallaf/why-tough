Justice social work: background and context 
 
Justice social work (JSW) services are currently part of local authorities, which are 
responsible for the delivery of community orders and related justice social work 
interventions, with support from partners including third sector organisations.  
The range of services JSW provide includes: 
• assessments and reports to assist decisions on sentencing 
• court services to assist those attending court 
• bail information and supervision services as an alternative to custodial remand 
• supervising people on social work orders to tackle offending behaviour and its 
causes 
• supervising people who are required to perform unpaid work for the benefit of the 
community 
• prison-based justice social work services to those serving custodial sentences 
that involve statutory supervision upon release 
• preparing reports for the Parole Board to assist decisions about release from 
prison 
• throughcare services including parole, supervised release and other prison 
aftercare orders to ensure public safety. 
The current model for community justice came into operation on 1 April 2017, 
underpinned by the Community Justice (Scotland) Act 2016, which places duties on a 
group of statutory partners to engage in community justice planning and to report 
against a set of nationally determined outcomes. This relies on effective partnership 
working at both local and national levels. Community justice partnerships in local 
authority areas are made up of a number of statutory partners and are supported by 
Community Justice Scotland, which was established in the above Act. 
Justice Social Work Workforce 
 
Currently, most social workers are employed by councils, with the remaining social 
workers employed in the voluntary and independent sectors. Social work comprises a 
wide range of services, including children’s services, adults and older people’s services, 
justice, and mental health services. 
• In 2020, there were 937 main grade or senior justice social workers, up from 898 
in 2011  
• If social work assistants, managers, admin, and support staff are included, there 
were a total of 1,950 workers in 2020, down from 2,000 in 2011   
To provide a comparison, in the same year (2020) there were 1,978 main grade or 
senior social workers who work predominately with adults including those with learning 
disabilities and the elderly. If social work assistants, managers, admin, and support staff 
are included, there were a total of 5,340 in 2020 which is an increase from 4,860 in 
2011. 
 
 
 
Background statistics on Scotland 
 
Scotland's population as of 2019 had the following high level statistics  
• On 30 June 2019, Scotland's population was estimated to be 5,463,300 with just 
over a quarter of people (26%) in Scotland aged 31 to 50 
• 
Overall Scotland had a relatively even split between sexes in 2019, with 51% 
female and 49% male, although this varied amongst age groups 
• 
 About 5% of the adult population were minority ethnic 
People going through the criminal proceedings in 2019-20 have a different profile to the 
general population: 
• A total of 85,700 people were proceeded against in Court in 2019-20. 
• There were 15 convictions per 1,000 of the people in Scotland’s population 
• There were 75,200 people who were convicted, 83% were male 
• About 50% of people who were convicted were aged 31 to 50 years 
Statistics from justice social work tend to reflect criminal proceedings in general (there 
are some exceptions): 
• There is a higher percentage of males than females reported  
• Just over half of people receiving the main community penalty (community 
payback order) were aged over 30. 
• Where ethnicity is known, around 4% of people define themselves as being of 
minority ethnicity 
 Information on range of services 
 
The information on justice social work in 2020-21 has been impacted by the nationwide 
lockdowns and other measures put in place to limit social contact during the 
Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This has had a substantial impact on social work 
activity. For example, Chart 3 shows the large decrease in volumes being experienced 
for social work orders. It has been decided to report evidence in this paper mainly on 
2019-20 activity, as these statistics were mostly pre-pandemic and better describe the 
volume of work supported by justice social workers in Scotland. (Any references to the 
last five years are taken at from 2019-20, unless otherwise stated). The main source of 
this information is taken from the National Statistics publication series: Criminal Justice 
Social Work Statistics in Scotland. (Any other sources will be referenced accordingly.) 
 
Diversion from prosecution 
 
Social workers provide support for diversion from prosecution. Diversion from 
prosecution schemes have been in existence in Scotland since the early 1980s and aim 
to provide support and advice in relation to the underlying causes of offending, such as 
substance use.  
• During 2019-20, there were around 3,100 referrals, 2,800 assessments and 
1,600 cases completed. 
• In 2019-20, there were 1,990 cases commenced for diversion from prosecution 
covering 1,930 individuals. A small number of these cases were referred to drug 
or alcohol treatment or mental health services. 
• Two–thirds of diversion of prosecution cases were for males in 2019-20. 
• The age profile shows that younger people’s cases are more likely to be diverted. 
(Chart 1).  
• The cases for 16 to 20 years old have represented 43 per cent of the total cases 
commenced in the last 5 years. 
• Where ethnicity was known, four  per cent of cases commenced in 2019-20 were 
for people of minority ethnicity.

Court-based services: bail information, pre-sentencing and sentencing 
reports 
 
There are various tasks associated with providing information and advice to the court: 
Bail information 
 
Bail information services assist procurators fiscal and courts through verification of 
information in cases where bail might otherwise have been opposed or refused. In a 
proportion of cases, this will result in a period of supervised bail 
• In 2019-20 there were 5,700 requests from court for bail information. 
• During this year there were 460 individuals who required bail supervision. This 
was the highest level in any of the last seven years. 
Same day reports 
 
A court may ask for a same day oral or written report from a court-based social worker 
during the court proceedings and adjourn a case until later in the day for this to be 
completed. A same day report will be a brief report and not a full justice social work 
report. Same day reports tend to deal with issues specific to the case to inform decision-
making. The information may be relevant to decisions regarding bail or custodial 
remand, the need for a full report or the need to defer a case to a future date and final 
sentence. 
• In 2019-20 there were 3,500 same day reports supplied to the courts. About one 
third of these were oral rather than written (Chart 2). 
• The trend for court services has changed over the last ten years, with more 
requests for written reports since 2017-18. 
 
 
 
Chart 2 Same Day Reports, 2011-12 to 2019-20 
 
 
Post sentence interviews 
Following someone being remanded into custody or receiving a custodial sentence for 
the first time, a court-based social worker will interview them. Some of the purposes of 
this interview are to: 
− Clarify the decision of the Court. 
− Establish whether any pressing problems should be dealt with immediately. 
− Assess risk of self-harm 
− Inform the prisoner about social work services in prison and how to access them. 
− Record details of the interview on a standard form. 
− Pass on any other information which may help the Scottish Prison Service in 
providing better care for the offender or in terms of public protection.

In 2019-20 there were 15,300 post-sentence interviews undertaken within court. This 
was lower than in any of the previous five years. 
Home Detention Curfew Assessment Reports 
 
Home Detention Curfew (HDC) allows prisoners, mainly on shorter sentences, to serve 
up to a quarter of their sentence (for a maximum of six months and a minimum of two 
weeks) on licence in the community, while wearing an electronic tag. The licence 
includes a range of standard conditions and a curfew condition that requires prisoners 
to remain at a particular place for a set period each day. Where it appears that an 
individual may qualify for release on HDC, the proposed curfew address must be 
assessed for suitability by local authority justice social work. 
• In 2019-20 there were 810 reports. This was lower than in any of the previous 
five years.  
Criminal Justice Social Work Reports 
 
The criminal justice social work report (CJSWR) is intended to assist in the sentencing 
process and to complement the range of other considerations, such as victim 
information and narratives from the Procurator Fiscal. The report includes key 
information, including the social worker's professional assessment and advice on social 
work interventions and how these may prevent or reduce further offending. 
A CJSWR must be requested: 
o before imposing a custodial sentence for the first time or where a person is 
under 21 
o when imposing a community payback order with a supervision requirement 
or level 2 (over 100 hours) unpaid work or other activity requirement 
o when imposing a drug treatment and testing order. 
 
There were 28,500 criminal justice social work reports submitted in 2019-20. This was 
four per cent higher than in 2018-19 but four per cent lower than in 2015-16. 
 
Social work orders 
 
Total social work orders include community payback, drug treatment & testing and fiscal 
work orders.  
• There were 17,600 social work orders commenced in 2019-20, a fall of one per 
cent on 2018-19, though 15 per cent lower than the peak in 2016-17 (Chart 3).  
• The vast majority of social work orders are community payback orders. The last 
five years this has been over 90 per cent. 
• In 2019-20, Glasgow City had the most social work orders commenced (2,600) 
and Na h-Eileanan Siar had the lowest (40)

Social work orders commenced (number)
Community payback orders 
 
The community payback order was introduced by the Criminal Justice and Licensing 
(Scotland) Act 2010 and replaced provisions for community service, probation and 
supervised attendance orders for offences committed from 1 February 2011 onwards. It 
is available to all courts, with some restrictions applying to justice of the peace courts in 
relation to treatment and program requirements. There are several different 
requirements which can be issued with a CPO, the most common of which are unpaid 
work or other activity and offender supervision. 
• The number of community payback orders (CPOs) imposed increased in the 
initial years following their introduction, reaching 19,500 in 2015-16. This rise was 
expected due to CPOs replacing legacy orders for offences committed on or after 
1 February 2011. 
• The total CPOs imposed then fell in the next three years to 16,500 in 2018-19. 
There was a small rise in 2019-20 of two per cent to 16,800. 
• Up to 2019-20, unpaid work or other activity has been the requirement most 
issued as part of a CPO. (Chart 5).  Every CPO must have either an unpaid work 
or other activity requirement or an offender supervision requirement, or both. 
However, the composition of orders has changed since 2015-16, with greater use 
being made of offender supervision and less being used of unpaid work or other 
activity  
 
 
Chart 5: Percentage of Community Payback Orders commenced, 2015-16 to 2019-

• In each of the years 2015-16 to 2019-20, 85 per cent of CPOs imposed were for 
males. 
• Around 70 per cent of CPO recipients in the last five years have been either 
unemployed or economically inactive. 
• In 2019-20, where ethnicity was known, four per cent of people getting a CPO 
were of minority ethnicity. This proportion has been around the same over the 
last five years. 
• The average age of people getting CPOs has risen, with 54 per cent aged over 
30 in 2019-20, compared to 48 per cent in 2015-16.

• The successful completion rate for CPOs terminated in 2019-20 was 69 per cent. 
Apart from the higher level in 2013-14, this rate has generally been around 70 
per cent since CPOs were introduced. 
• Completion rates in 2019-20 varied by age and employment status: 
o Rates were relatively similar for all age groups up to age 40, ranging from 
64 per cent for those aged 18 to 20 to 68 per cent for under 18s (and 66 
per cent for those aged 40 or under as a whole). However, for people 
aged over 40, the rate was much higher at 77 per cent. 
o Eighty-two per cent of those who were employed or self-employed 
completed successfully, compared to 63 per cent of those who were 
unemployed or economically inactive. 
 
Drug treatment and testing orders 
 
The drug treatment and testing order (DTTO) is available to courts (excluding justice of 
the peace courts) as a high tariff disposal for people with substance-related offending 
who might otherwise get a custodial sentence. 
• The total number of DTTOs commenced fell in both 2015-16 and 2016-17 to a 
low of 480, before rising in each of the next two years (Chart 8). 
• Numbers fell again in 2019-20, by 14 per cent, to 520, around the same as in 
2015-16.

• In 2019-20, over three-quarters of DTTOs were for people aged over 30. 
• Just over one per cent of DTTO recipients in 2019-20 were of minority ethnicity.

• The successful completion rate for DTTOs was 50 per cent in 2015-16 but fell in 
each of the next three years, to 37 per cent in 2018-19. It rose only slightly to 39 
per cent in 2019-20. 
Fiscal work orders 
 
Fiscal work orders (FWOs) were introduced nationally on 1 April 2015 and allow 
Procurators Fiscal to offer unpaid work orders as an alternative to prosecution. They 
can be for a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 50 hours and should be completed 
within six months.

• The number of FWOs commenced in Scotland increased from the base level of 
510 in 2015-16 to 1,030 in 2017-18. However, numbers then dropped sharply, to 
630 in 2018-19 and 250 in 2019-20. 
• Successful completion rates have consistently been high for FWOs, over 78 per 
cent in the last five years. 
Structured deferred sentences 
 
Structured deferred sentences (SDS) offer courts the option to provide a short period of 
intensive supervision to individuals post-conviction but prior to final sentencing. They 
are designed to help individuals address their underlying issues, improve their 
employment prospects and build a sense of routine and self-esteem, allowing them to 
move away from offending. SDS are not a statutory order and as such are not used by 
every local authority. Areas with SDS schemes may utilise it as part of an early 
intervention approach, as an alternative or precursor to a community sentence or as an 
alternative to a short period of custody depending on the needs of the local area. 
• There were 890 structured deferred sentences imposed in 2019-20. 
• Three-quarters of structured deferred sentences were given to males. 
• Just over half of structured deferred sentences were given to people aged over 
30. 
Throughcare 
 
Justice social work departments are expected to provide a throughcare service to all 
those who are subject to statutory supervision on release from prison. This includes 
people serving sentences of four years or more (or six months or more for sexual 
offences) as well as those subject to an extended sentence or supervised release order. 
Throughcare begins at the start of the sentence and is implemented through the 
Scottish Prison Service's Integrated Case Management process. Voluntary throughcare 
services are also available to those who are not subject to supervision on release from 
prison. These services may be requested while in custody or up to 12 months after 
release. 
• There were 1,900 statutory throughcare cases commenced in 2019-20, 97 per 
cent of which were for males. 
• Just over half of all throughcare cases commenced (1,000 individuals) were for 
people who are subject to statutory supervision on release. 
• The number of statutory throughcare cases in force as of 31 March 2020, was 
6,100. 
• There were 2,000 voluntary throughcare cases commenced during 2019-20, 87 
per cent of which were for males. There were also 1,800 individuals who 
received assistance. 
Pre-release report statistics 
 
Part of statutory throughcare involves preparing reports to inform temporary release 
from prison on home leave and liberation on licence. Social workers did the following 
number of such reports in 2019-20: 
• The number of home leave reports completed was 1,600. 
• There were 2,300 parole/non-parole reports.
