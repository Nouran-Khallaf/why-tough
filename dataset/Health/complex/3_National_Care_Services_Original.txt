Scotland’s Health and Demographic Profile 
 
This paper provides an overview of Scotland’s health and demographic profile, 
drawing on evidence about life expectancy, healthy life expectancy, the 
burden of disease and multimorbidity, as well as population projections. It is 
part of an initial collection of contextual evidence papers, setting out key 
sources of information about social care and related areas in Scotland, linking 
to the National Care Service Consultation proposals published in August 
2021. 
Key findings 
• Scotland’s population has the lowest life expectancy and widest socio-
economic inequalities in health in Western Europe. In 2018-20, life 
expectancy at birth in Scotland was 76.8 years for males and 81.0  
years for females. The gap in life expectancy between the most and 
least deprived Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) deciles was 
13.5 years for males and 10.2 years for females. 
 
• The estimated healthy life expectancy of a child born in Scotland in 
2018-20 was 60.9 (± 0.5) years for males and 61.8 (± 0.5) years for 
females. While socio-economic inequalities in life expectancy are stark, 
socio-economic inequalities in healthy life expectancy are even wider. 
The estimated gap in healthy life expectancy between males and 
females across the most and least deprived deciles in 2018-20 was 
24.4 and 24.2 years, respectively. 
 
• While predicting future demand for social care is extremely challenging, 
National Records of Scotland project that Scotland’s population is 
expected to age across the coming decades, with a substantial increase 
in the proportion of the population over the age of 65 years. The trend 
towards an increasing number of single adult households is also set to 
continue.  
 
• A recent study found that 93% of people aged over 65 who received 
social care had two or more medical conditions simultaneously 
(multimorbidity).

Introduction 
 
Following a brief overview of the drivers associated with demand for social 
care across the population, this paper provides an overview of the health 
profile of Scotland’s population, including the distribution across the population 
of indicators such as life expectancy, healthy life expectancy, the burden of 
disease and multimorbidity. It then draws on projections made by National 
Records for Scotland (NRS) in relation to health and demographics across the 
coming decades, laying a foundation for discussion of how these shifts will 
come to shape demand for social care. Throughout the paper, focus is placed 
on aspects of population health and demographics which are relevant to the 
demand for social care. This paper incorporates evidence from both peer-
reviewed academic and grey literature, including a number of recent statistical 
publications from National Records for Scotland (NRS). 
 
This paper forms one of an initial collection of contextual evidence papers, 
setting out key sources of information about social care and related areas in 
Scotland, linking to the National Care Service Consultation proposals 
published in August 2021. 
  
The collection consists of the following 6 papers on social care: 
 
1. Scotland’s Health and Demographic Profile 
2. People who Access Social Care and Unpaid Carers in Scotland 
3. Social Care Support and Service Provision in Scotland 
4. Experiences of Social Care and Caring in Scotland 
5. The Adult Social Care Workforce in Scotland 
6. Adult Social Care in Scotland - Equality Evidence Overview 
 
And papers on: 
 
7. Children’s Social Services 
8. Justice Social Work in Scotland 
9. Learning and evidence from national social care systems in Nordic and 
Scandinavian countries 
10. Integrated Care Studies: The SCFNuka (Alaska) and Canterbury (New 
Zealand) Models 
 
While the focus of this set of evidence papers is social care, there is an 
intrinsic link between social care and social work. Social work is a statutory 
role which involves assessing need, managing risk, and promoting and 
protecting the wellbeing of individuals and communities. Social care support is 
an umbrella term for adult, children’s and justice services which directly 
support people to meet their personal outcomes. A social work evidence 
paper is being prepared for publication in summer 2022.

Factors associated with Demand for Social Care 
 
Accurately forecasting demands for social care is highly complex, given that 
there is a vast range of mental and physical illnesses and conditions 
associated with need for social care, a range of associated treatments and 
services, and the factors which interplay with demand are wide-reaching and 
challenging to predict (including technological developments in healthcare and 
treatment)1. Factors which have been noted as associated with demand for 
social care in the previous literature include prevalence rates of disease2, 
mortality rates3, cultural attitudes towards social care of older adults4, future 
health profile projections5, living arrangements6 and the socio-economic profile 
of the population7. However, making projections based on current rates of 
social care utilisation, or by the current health profile of the population is 
complex and uncertain.

Overview of Scotland’s Health Profile 
 
This section provides an overview of the health profile of Scotland’s 
population, placing focus on aspects relevant to the development of a National 
Care Service. It outlines the country’s health profile in terms of overall life 
expectancy, healthy life expectancy, the burden of disease and multimorbidity. 
Throughout these subsections, it explores how these indicators are shaped by 
socio-economic and demographic factors. While some emphasis is placed on 
measures such as life expectancy, it is important to note that demand for 
social care is not restricted to those of older age. As noted in the section on 
multimorbidity and healthy life expectancy, demand for social care is seen 
across a far wider section of Scotland’s population.

3.1 
Life Expectancy 
 
3.1.1 Overview 
 
Scotland has the lowest life expectancy at birth of any Western European 
country8,9. In 2018-2020, life expectancy at birth10 in Scotland was 76.8 years 
for males and 81.0 years for females11; 2.3 and 1.8 years shorter than across the 
UK as a whole, respectively.

Source: Life Expectancy in Scotland 2018-2020: Report (nrscotland.gov.uk) 
 
Having increased since the early 1980s, life expectancy in Scotland remained 
virtually unchanged between 2012-2014 and 2017-2019. Between 2017-2019 
and 2018-20, life expectancy across Scotland declined, dropping below the 
2012-2014 figure (Figure 1). This represents a decrease of around 17.6 weeks 
(0.3 years) for males and 6.1 weeks (0.1 years) for females since the previous 
year’s estimates - the biggest annual decrease since the series began. A 
similar stalling in trends has been seen across the rest of the UK and some 
other countries including the USA, with life expectancy having fallen over the 
latest year in all UK countries.

10 The life expectancy estimates presented in this report relate to ‘period’ life expectancy. They are 
calculated assuming that mortality rates for each age group in the time period (here 2018-2020) are 
constant throughout a person’s life. Given that future changes in factors such as medicine and 
legislation are not taken into consideration, period life expectancy is not an accurate prediction of how 
long a person born today will actually live, but is a useful measure of population health at a point in 
time and is most useful for comparing trends over time, between areas of a country and with other 
countries.

In terms of direct causes underlying this decrease, deaths from Covid-19 
accounted for the majority, while drug-related deaths and deaths from external 
causes (including accidents and suicides) also had a negative effect on life 
expectancy. Wider analyses have suggested that UK Government changes to 
tax and welfare from 2010/11 have contributed to these trends12. 
 
3.1.2 Socio-economic Inequalities in Life Expectancy 
 
As well as the lowest life expectancy, Scotland has the widest socio-economic 
inequalities in health13 of any country in Western Europe. While life 
expectancy varies between geographical areas, like local authorities and 
health boards, the difference in life expectancy is far greater when levels of 
deprivation are taken into account. In 2018-20, the gap in life expectancy 
between the most and least deprived Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 
(SIMD) deciles14 was 13.5 years for males (68.9 – 82.4 years) and 10.2 years 
for females (75.4 – 85.6 years) (Figure 2). This gap has widened over the past 
few years, growing by 1.3 years for males and 1.6 years for females since 
2013-2015, with life expectancy falling in the most deprived and increasing in 
the least deprived areas15.

14 The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is a measure of how deprived an area is. A score 
is given to all of Scotland’s datazones (small area geographies) based on several indicators of 
deprivation. The datazones are then ranked 1 to 6,976 based on their score. The rankings are split 
into 10 equally sized groups for SIMD deciles and five groups for SIMD quintiles. More information

3.1.3 Geographic Inequalities in Life Expectancy 
 
There are also substantial geographic inequalities in health across Scotland, 
largely reflecting socio-economic inequalities between areas. Across council 
areas, female life expectancy at birth was highest in East Renfrewshire (84.0 
(±0.6) years) and lowest in Glasgow City (78.3 (±0.3) years). Male life 
expectancy at birth was highest in Shetland Islands (80.6 (±1.3) years) and 
lowest in Glasgow City (73.1 (±0.3) years); this represents 5.7 fewer years of 
life for females and 7.5 fewer years of life for males compared with East 
Renfrewshire and Shetland Islands respectively. The rate of growth in life 
expectancy has slowed or stalled in the majority of Scotland’s local authority 
areas since 2012-2014 and many areas now have decreasing life expectancy, 
with Inverclyde, Dundee City and South Ayrshire experiencing some of the 
biggest decreases. 
 
Life expectancy also varies by rurality across Scotland. People living in more 
rural areas generally live longer and spend more years in good health than 
those in more urban areas16. For males, life expectancy was highest in 
‘Accessible Rural’ areas at 79.4 (±0.3) years and lowest in ‘Large Urban’ 
areas (75.7 ±0.2 years). For females, it was highest in ‘Remote Rural’ areas at 
83.2 (±0.3) years and lowest in ‘Other Urban’ areas (80.2 ±0.1 years). This is

relevant to the development of a National Care Service given the challenges 
associated with rural services, which may require greater service costs, 
stemming from reduced opportunities for economies of scale, higher travel 
costs and time, and challenges relating to staffing, training, development and 
partnership working17. 
 
3.1.4 Life Expectancy at Older Ages, and ‘Time to Death’  
 
Another relevant measure of life expectancy estimates the number of years 
individuals aged 65 years can expect to live. In 2018-20, 65 year old males 
and females could expect to live another 17.5 and 19.8 years, respectively. 
For 85 years old males and females, life expectancy in 2018-20 was 5.6 years 
and 6.4 years, respectively. Figure 3 shows how life expectancy at older ages 
has changed since 1980-82. Life expectancy for males aged 65 has increased 
by 5.2 years across this time series, and by 3.7 years for females. For those 
aged 85, life expectancy for males has increased by 1.4 years, and 1.2 years 
for females, between 1980-1982 and 2018-20.

Life expectancy estimates can also be used to look at population ageing. As 
life expectancy increases, the age at which a person is ‘elderly’ or 
approaching death changes. This definition is important, as we define the 
‘elderly’ population as those aged over 65. However, studies show that a lot of 
the health problems related to old age are more closely associated with how

long someone has left to live, rather than how long they have already lived. 
This means it may be more useful for health and social care policy to look at 
how many people have only 15 years of life expectancy remaining, rather than 
the number of people aged 65 and over. Figure 4 shows the average age at 
which males and females in Scotland have only 15 years of life remaining. 
This age has risen from 66.5 in females in 1981-1983 to 71.1 in 2018-2020. 
For males, the average age at which 15 years of life remains has risen from 
60.8 to 68.5 over the same period.

3.2 
Healthy Life Expectancy 
 
3.2.1 Overview  
 
Healthy life expectancy (HLE) is an estimate of the number of years lived in 
‘very good’ or ‘good’ general health, based on how individuals perceive their 
state of health at the time of completing the annual population survey (APS)18. 
The estimated healthy life expectancy of a child born in 2018-20 was 61.8 (± 
0.5) years for females, and 60.9 (± 0.5) years for males19. For males, HLE at 
birth increased between 2009-2011 and 2015-2017, but has decreased since 
and is now lower than in 2009-2011. Female HLE at birth was relatively stable 
between 2009-2011 and 2014-2016 but has since decreased each year 
(Figure 5).

Although both life expectancy and HLE have fallen for males in recent years, 
HLE has done so at a faster rate. This means that a greater proportion of life 
will likely be spent in poor health than in previous years. Life expectancy at 
birth for females has experienced relatively little change since 2010-2012 
although it has fallen by a larger amount over the past year. HLE has 
consistently been higher for females than males but by a much smaller margin 
than overall life expectancy and in the last few years the difference has not 
been statistically significant. This means that a greater proportion of life for 
females is spent in poor health compared to males. The proportion of life 
spent in good health has also been decreasing more rapidly for females than 
males.

3.2.2 Socio-economic Inequalities in Healthy Life Expectancy 
 
Socio-economic inequalities in healthy life expectancy are wider than 
inequalities in life expectancy. Using SIMD deciles20, males born in the most 
deprived decile were estimated to have an HLE of 45.4 (±2.2) years, 
compared to 69.7 (±1.4) years for males in the least deprived decile; a 
difference of 24.4 years (Figure 6). Females born in the most deprived decile 
were estimated to have an HLE of 48.6 (±1.9) years, compared to 72.9 (±1.4) 
years for females in the least deprived decile; a difference of 24.2 years 
(Figure 7). 
                                             
20 See footnote 14 for further information.

intervals, 2018-2020, females 
 
 
Source: Healthy Life Expectancy 2018-2020 (NRS) 
 
Males in the least deprived areas are expected to spend 84.6% of their life in 
good health compared with 65.8% in the most deprived areas. Females in the 
 
12 
 
least deprived areas are expected to spend 85.2% of their life in good health 
compared with 64.5% in the most deprived areas. 
 
For both males and females, the difference in HLE between the most and 
least deprived areas is much larger than the difference in LE. The result of this 
is that people in the most deprived areas not only have shorter life expectancy 
and lower HLE, but they also have a smaller proportion of life spent in good 
health. 
 
3.2.3 Geographic Inequalities in Healthy Life Expectancy 
 
There are also wide regional variations in HLE, again largely rooted in socio-
economic inequalities. For males in 2018-20, HLE at birth was highest in 
Orkney Islands (71.2 (±5.1) years), East Renfrewshire (68.7 (±1.8) years) and 
Na h-Eileanan Siar (68.3 (±3.1) years). For females in 2018-20, HLE at birth 
was highest in Orkney Islands (77.5 (±3.6) years), Na h-Eileanan Siar 
(67.5(±3.8) years) and East Renfrewshire (67.0 (±2.7) years). In comparison, 
for males in 2018-20, HLE at birth was lowest in Inverclyde (54.4 (±2.8) 
years), Glasgow City (56.0 (±1.8) years) and Dundee City (56.1 (±2.3) years). 
For females in 2018-20, HLE at birth was lowest in North Ayrshire (54.0 (±2.5) 
years), North Lanarkshire (55.5 (±2.4) years) and Glasgow City (57.4 (±2.2) 
years)21. 
 
The difference between the HLE expectancy estimates in the most urban and 
most rural areas is 6.9 years for males and 3.6 years for females.  The rural 
categories show the highest HLE estimates whilst the urban areas have the 
lowest in both males and females. 
 
3.2.4 Healthy Life Expectancy at Older Ages 
 
Another measure is HLE at 65 years. In 2017-19, the estimated HLE at 65 
years was 10.7 (± 0.3) years for females and 9.9 (± 0.3) years for males. 
 
Over the last decade, male HLE at 65 has experienced an increase whilst 
female HLE at 65 has remained relatively unchanged since 2009-2011. Due to 
an ageing population, this means females are estimated to spend a greater 
proportion of their life in bad health than previously experienced, as the 
healthy life expectancy at 65 is not increasing in line with the increasing life 
expectancy. 
 
 
                                             
21 Some of the island council areas are amongst those with the highest recorded HLE estimates, 
however they also have the widest confidence intervals because they have small populations and this 
makes their HLE estimates less reliable. Further information is available in NRS Healthy Life 
Expectancy 2018-2020

3.3 
Burden of Disease 
 
Burden of disease is a measure of the health of the population. It aims to 
quantify the difference between living to old age in good health, and the 
situation in which healthy life is shortened by illness, injury, disability and early 
death22. The latest data on the burden of disease across Scotland come from 
ScotPHO, whose Scottish Burden of Disease (SBoD) study team have 
produced comprehensive estimates of Scotland's disease, condition and injury 
burden for 201623. 
 
The health problems which cause the most non-fatal burden (proportion of the 
year lived with disability – YLD), include disability associated with anxiety, 
depression and dementia, along with diseases linked to health-related 
behaviours (in relation to diet, exercise, tobacco, alcohol and drugs24), and 
those caused by our living longer. Figure 8 displays the leading causes of 
disability in Scotland. ScotPHO note that there were more person-years25 lived 
in less than ideal health due to depression in 2016 than there were lost to 
early deaths from lung cancer, and more person-years lived in less than ideal 
health due to low back and neck pain than lost to early deaths from stroke. 
 
 
 
                                             
22 Burden of disease studies use a single measure which combines fatal burden [i.e. years lost 
because of early death – years of life lost (YLL)] and non-fatal burden [i.e. years lost because they are 
lived in less than ideal health – years lived with disability (YLD)]. The measure used to describe the 
overall burden of disease is called the disability-adjusted life year (DALY).  
23 ScotPHO Archive - Scottish Burden of Disease (SBoD) 
24 It is important to note that a vast body of epidemiological and sociological research highlights that 
health-related behaviours are shaped to a large degree by structural determinants, and that socio-
economic inequalities in health persist even when these behaviours are controlled for statistically. 
See: Katikireddi, S.V.; Higgins, M.; Smith, K.E. & Williams, G. (2013). Health inequalities: The need to

There are wide inequalities in the burden of disease by socio-economic 
deprivation. Overall, 1,305,000 disability adjusted life years (DALY) were lost 
due to ill health or early death in Scotland in 201626. This ranged from around 
184,000 (14.1% of the total) in the most deprived areas to 88,000 (6.7%) in 
the least deprived areas of Scotland27. Total burden increased with increasing 
levels of deprivation. An estimated 32.9% of these DALY are ‘excess’; the 
total burden that would have been avoided if all deprivation deciles had the 
same rate as the least deprived areas in Scotland. Over 50% of the total 
burden in the most deprived decile was excess, in comparison with the least 
deprived.

Multimorbidity 
 
Discussion of multimorbidity is relevant here as it has multiple implications, 
including mortality, unplanned hospital admissions28, primary care 
consultations, polypharmacy, and the need for care29. The proportion of 
individuals who have two or more medical conditions simultaneously (referred 
to as ‘multimorbidity’) has risen across high income countries, including the

UK30, partly reflecting increases in life expectancy across recent decades. 
Projections suggest that this trend is set to continue31. While these trends 
reflect the ageing profile of populations, it is important to note that 
multimorbidity is not restricted to older people.  
 
A recent cross-sectional study which linked national health and social care 
data to explore multimorbidity and social care use in those aged over 65, 
found that 93.3% of those receiving social care had multimorbidity, and that 
16.2% of those with multimorbidity had received social care, compared with 
3.7% of those without32. This study also explored how a number of factors – 
age, deprivation and gender – affected the likelihood of receiving social care. 
Age showed the largest margin of effect; compared with those aged 65-69 
years old, the probability of receiving social care increased by 2.2% in the 70-
74 age group, to almost 50% for those aged over 95 years. Those in the most 
deprived SIMD decile were 5.5% more likely to receive social care compared 
with those in the least deprived. Small gender differences were apparent too, 
with women having a 3.2% increased probability of receiving social care than 
men. 
 
While now a decade old, a nationally representative study of almost 1.8 million 
people in Scotland derived from primary care electronic records found a 
multimorbidity prevalence rate of 24%, with the majority of people over the 
age of 65 years having multimorbidity33. Again, this study also found 
inequalities in multimorbidity across Scotland, with people living in the most 
deprived areas having higher rates of multimorbidity, with onset 10-15 years 
earlier, than those living in the least deprived areas. The combination of 
mental and physical health problems is most common in deprived areas, 
although pain and depression are in the top five conditions in people with 
multimorbidity of all ages, and across all deprivation levels34. 
 
A recent study also demonstrated inverse care from GPs in relation to 
multimorbidity in Glasgow; despite the greater need of patients with 
multimorbidity in deprived areas, the study found longer consultation length, 
higher GP patient centeredness and higher perceived GP empathy in less 
deprived areas of the city35.

Projections 
 
This section briefly explores a number of projections which have been made, 
primarily by NRS, which are relevant to the development of a National Care 
Service. Population projections have limitations. A projection is a calculation 
showing what happens if particular assumptions are made. The population 
projections are trend-based. They are, therefore, not policy-based forecasts of 
what the government expects to happen. Many social and economic factors 
influence population change, including policies adopted by both central and 
local government. The relationships between the various factors are complex 
and largely unknown. Nonetheless, projections of the number of adults 
(particularly older people) are usually more reliable than those for children 
because they are based on people who are already living in Scotland. 
 
4.1 
Life Expectancy 
 
As noted, life expectancy in Scotland had been increasing steadily for 
decades. However, since 2012-14, improvements in life expectancy have 
stalled. NRS projections show life expectancy increasing again, but at a 
slower rate than previous projections (Figure 9). 
 
However, it is important to note that life expectancy and healthy life 
expectancy trends in Scotland have not improved since around 2012, with life 
expectancy having been decreasing for those living in the most deprived 40% 
of areas36. The best available evidence indicates that this is largely due to 
economic factors impacting on the whole population, but particularly on those 
living in the most deprived circumstances. These trends reflect the impact on 
health of an array of social determinants; socio-economic circumstances, 
including poverty, housing and education that together influence health 
throughout the life-course. The future course of life expectancy and healthy 
life expectancy are dependent on future decisions around these key social 
determinants.

4.2 
Ageing Population 
 
The age composition of the population is particularly important in this context, 
given that it shapes demand for health and social care services. Projections 
by NRS suggest that Scotland is likely to have more older people and fewer 
younger people in mid-2045 than in mid-202037. The current (mid-2020) 
population structure includes a sharp peak at around age 73 (post-war baby 
boomers, born 1946-47), and a large bulge with people in their mid-50s (born 
during the 1960s baby boom). As these generations age, with higher life 
expectancy than in previous generations, they are projected to make up a 
growing proportion of the population. Also, as female life expectancy is higher 
than for males, more females are projected to live into older age. These 
projections suggest that the number of people aged 65 and over will grow by 
nearly a third by mid-2045 to make up 25.4%, with the number of children 
falling by over a fifth to 13.3% of the population. The population aged 16-64 
years is projected to remain relatively stable and is projected to make up 
61.3% of the population by mid-2045. Most of the changes are the result of 
the ageing population.

2045

Scotland's age-structural shift is also projected to contain increasing numbers 
of people aged in, what demographers refer to as, the 'oldest old' age 
categories. For example, NRS projects that the number of people aged 90 and 
over in Scotland will double between 2020 and 2045 from 43,749 to 85,354. 
 
4.3 
Increase in Single-Person Households 
 
Another key NRS projection, relevant here, is the continuation of trends 
towards estimated increase in single-person households across Scotland. In 
2019 more than a third of households were single person households38. The 
largest projected increases between 2018 and 2028 (in number and 
percentage terms) is in households containing one or two adults only. The 
number of one person households is projected to increase further by 8% (to 
965,100 households); and the number of households with just two adults is 
projected to increase by 7% (to 830,600 households)39. 
 
Importantly here, people are more likely to live alone as they become older. In 
2018, an estimated 113,800 men aged 65 and over were living alone. This is 
projected to increase to 139,500 in 2028 (an increase of 23%) and to 161,400

by 2043 (an increase of 42% compared with 2018). The number of women 
aged 65 and over living alone is projected to increase from 229,200 in 2018 to 
245,900 in 2028 (increase of 16%) and to 326,900 by 2043 (an increase of 
43% compared with 2018). The number of men aged 85 and over living alone 
is projected to increase by just over a quarter (26%) between 2018 and 2028, 
increasing from 17,600 to 22,100; and to nearly double to 33,700 by 2043 (an 
increase of 92% compared with 2018). The number of women aged 85 and 
over living alone is also projected to increase from 49,700 in 2018 to 59,400 in 
2028 (an increase of 20%) and then to 90,900 by 2043 (an increase of 83% 
compared with 2018). In 2028, 65% of women in this age group are projected 
to live alone, compared to 39% of men. The substantial projected increase in 
the number of older households, in particular of older people living alone, has 
implications for services and policies aimed at supporting older people.

Conclusion 
 
This paper has outlined aspects of Scotland’s current and projected national 
health profile and demographics which are of relevance to the development of 
a National Care Service. It has highlighted that Scotland’s population has the 
lowest life expectancy and widest socio-economic inequalities in health in 
Western Europe, as well as socio-economic inequalities in healthy life 
expectancy. Geographic inequalities exist too – including between urban and 
rural areas – but to a lesser degree, and largely shaped by these socio-
economic inequalities. 
 
While forecasting demand for social care is extremely challenging, a number 
of projections made by NRS are of relevance here. The country’s population is 
expected to age considerably across the coming decades, with a substantial 
increase in the proportion of those over the age of 65. The trend towards an 
increasing number of single-adult households is also set to continue.
