What is next 
What is next for NCS Workforce Charter? 
 
We will continue to speak to and work 
with: 
• Representatives of the workforce 
• Trade unions 
• Local authorities 
• Convention of Scottish Local 
Authorities 
We will speak to them to find out if and 
how a workforce charter could benefit the 
workforce.  
 
We will continue to run co-design 
sessions until the launch of the NCS. 
Our co-design sessions will give people 
with lived experience of accessing and 
delivering support the opportunity to 
influence and further develop a workforce 
charter.  
4 
 
 
 
We will think about how the workforce 
charter works with the Charter of Rights. 
And how it works with other guidance and 
laws. 
To do this we will work with people 
working for Scottish Government and their 
advisors.  
 
We will create examples of a workforce 
charter to help discussions during the next 
phase of co-design.  
 
During the next phase, we will test the 
examples with people to see what they 
think would be achievable and which 
would benefit them.

What is next for the National Care Service 
 
Members of Scottish Parliament (MSPs) 
have been discussing a National Care 
Service and how it could work by looking 
at the NCS Bill.  
A Bill is a proposed law that needs to be 
passed by the Parliament before it can 
become a law. The first stage of this 
(Stage 1 of the Bill) includes: 
 
 
• hearing the views of people, 
including people with lived 
experience of using and providing 
care support services 
6 
 
 
 
 
• writing reports on what they have 
heard 
 
 
• voting on whether the NCS Bill 
should be taken to the next stage 
 
 
The NCS Bill passed Stage 1 in the 
Scottish Parliament in February 2024.  
 
7 
 
 
 
The NCS Bill will now enter Stage 2. 
This is where MSPs can make changes 
to the Bill.

Care Service Bill, visit National Care
