About the National Care Service 
 
The Scottish Government is working to 
improve community health and social care 
support.  
We are working with people across 
Scotland. 
 
We want everyone to have access to high-
quality local services across Scotland.  
People should get them when they need 
them. 
 
This is why we are designing a National 
Care Service (NCS). 
The NCS will be designed with people and 
groups who have experience of accessing 
and delivering: 
• social care support 
• social work services 
• community health services 
4 
 
 
Introduction 
 
As part of the co-design of the National 
Care Service we have been speaking to 
the people who work in: 
• social care support 
• social work services 
• community health services 
The National Care Service is sometimes 
called the NCS. 
 
Co-design means: 
• you can share your ideas and 
experiences with us 
• work with other people to find out 
how we can make things better 
5 
 
 
  
 
A Workforce Charter is a document that 
helps support workers. 
 
This report shares the findings from our 
research and co-design that relate to a 
NCS Workforce Charter.

About the workforce co-design theme 
 
Our co-design of the NCS, has been 
split up into themes. One of these 
themes is called Valuing the workforce. 
 
The Valuing the workforce theme 
allowed us to hear about the experiences 
of community health and social care 
workers. 
We wanted to hear about what makes 
community health and social care 
workers feel valued and supported. 
 
We have been looking at ways that a 
NCS Workforce Charter could make 
community health and social care 
workers feel engaged, valued, and 
support.

About the workforce charter co-design sessions 
 
In 2023 we had a number of co-design 
sessions in different parts of Scotland.  
Workers from social work, social care and 
community health attended the sessions.  
During these sessions, the idea of a NCS 
Workforce Charter was discussed. 
 
To further discuss the idea of a NCS 
Workforce Charter, we ran more co-design 
sessions from: 
• November 2023 to January 2024  
• April 2024 to June 2024 
 
8 
 
 
 
In these sessions we heard from: 
• social work, social care and 
community health workers 
• people who represent social work, 
social care and community health 
workers 
• People working for Scottish 
Government and their advisors 
 
All of the co-design sessions were online 
so that people from different parts of 
Scotland could take part. 
 
Some sessions were only for specific 
groups of people. These included: 
• Trade union members 
• Black and ethnic minority workers 
members 
• Personal assistants 
• Disabled members of workers 
9 
 
 
This was to help these groups of people 
feel safe to share their experiences. 
 
In the co-design sessions we discussed: 
• if a workforce charter would be 
beneficial  
• what we would use a workforce 
charter for 
• the content of a workforce charter  
What we learned 
 
We heard lots of different ideas in our 
sessions. 
 
We learned 8 main things. 
10 
 
 
 
• People who work in social care, 
social work and health want to feel 
like they belong in a NCS workforce 
 
• People need to understand who we 
mean when we talk about NCS 
workforce 
 
• People in the workforce need to 
understand what we mean when we 
talk about shared values 
11 
 
 
 
• People think having workforce rights 
in a workforce charter would make 
them easier to understand 
 
• People in the workforce like the idea 
of the NCS making a pledge to 
support them 
 
• People in the workforce do not need 
a workforce charter to tell them about 
their role and responsibilities 
12 
 
 
 
• Some other things need to be in 
place for a workforce charter to be 
useful. For example, there needs to 
be enough staff 
 
• We need to think carefully about how 
a workforce charter will be used by 
the workforce 
 
How we will use this 
 
We will use what he have heard to: 
• Understand how a workforce charter 
can help and support the workforce 
13 
 
 
 
• Decide who we need to speak to in 
our next round of co-design sessions 
 
• Decide what information to include in 
a workforce charter. We will test an 
example of a workforce charter with 
people in the workforce 
 
How to find out more

We have changed the way we make our 
longer documents and reports into easy 
read versions. 
 
Before, we would have the same detail 
and information in both our plain English 
and easy read versions. 
 
 
But that made easy read documents 
very long.  
15 
 
 
 
To make them shorter and easier to 
read, we will now make our easy read 
documents a summary of the main 
report. 
Read more about why we have made 
this change.
