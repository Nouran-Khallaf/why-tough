People who work in adult social care services in 
Scotland 
 
 
In 2020 there were more than 1 
hundred and 34 thousand people 
working in adult social care jobs in 
Scotland 
This is a bit more than in 2011.  
This is because there are more people 
working in housing support and care at 
home services. 
 
 
 
In 2020 most adult social care staff in 
Scotland were female. 
Nearly half of adult social care staff 
were aged 45 and over.  
On average adult social care staff 
worked for 31 hours per week.  
 
 
Most people were employed on 
permanent contracts.  
This means that the job is there for as 
long as someone wants it.

Brexit and Covid-19 have both had a 
big effect on the adult social care 
workforce.  
Nearly half of all social care employers 
and organisations said they had job 
vacancies. 
It is hardest to get people to do jobs in: 
• care at home 
• housing support 
• care homes for older people 
  
 
 
Many people who work in social care 
jobs do not have enough qualifications. 
In 2020 just over half of social care staff 
had the right qualifications for their job. 
 
   
 
 
 
In 2020 the private sector employed the 
most people in adult social care. 
They employ nearly half of the people 
in the workforce.  
Most people working in adult social 
care are in: 
• housing support and care at home  
• care homes for adults 
4 
 
  
By 2045 Scotland will have more older 
people and less younger people. 
 
This will affect: 
• how many people will need social 
care 
 
• how many people will be available 
to work in social care jobs
