Getting it Right for Everyone

We want to have a way of working called GIRFE. This stands for Getting It Right for Everyone.

It will be an easier way for people to get support and services when they need them from when they are a young adult up to the end of their life.

The person must be at the centre of the process. They must get the support and services that are right for them. 3

Staff, communities and services must work with the person and their families to find what they want to happen.

Everyone supporting them must look at what matters to the person. They must support them with their hopes and dreams and to get the life they want.

People should get support as early as possible without lots of paperwork.

GIRFE will make sure all staff use the same words and work in the same way to describe what a person can do well and to decide what they need.



Every person who needs support will be part of GIRFE including: • young people moving from Children’s Services

• people at risk of harm

• people after they have left prison

• older people who have physical or mental disabilities.
