Support Planning 
 
 
 
A person will only have one plan.  
 
 
 
 
Support planning will start when a 
person first needs it and move with the 
person through their life.  
The plan should: 
 
 
 
 
• have the person at the centre of any 
decisions that are made. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• respect their human rights. 
 
3 
 
 
 
• be based on the family and friend 
relationships that are important to the 
person. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• work with the person to get the life 
they want and need.  
 
 
 
• plan things in a way that looks at 
someone’s strengths and what they 
are good at.   
 
People will manage their own care as 
much as they want to. 
 
 
• have similar ways of giving services 
and support.   
 
Planning could be done by different 
people – for example: 
 
• if someone does not need a lot of 
support the planning could be done 
by someone in the community like a 
support worker or someone from a 
voluntary organisation. 
4 
 
 
 
 
• if someone needs a lot of support 
from different services the planning 
could be done by a social worker. 
 
 
 
• support information will be written 
down on a social care and health 
record with their agreement. 
 
People’s information will move through 
the system with them. 
 
 
 
 
• People will only have to come into 
services once.   
 
They must get support in a system 
where services work together and talk 
to each other.
