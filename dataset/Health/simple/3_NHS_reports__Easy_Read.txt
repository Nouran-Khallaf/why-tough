Social care services in Nordic countries 
 
 
What did we do? 
We looked at health and social care 
systems from Nordic countries from 
2010 to 2022. 
Nordic countries are Norway, Sweden, 
Finland and Denmark. 
 
 
What we found 
There was not one way of delivering 
social care services in the countries we 
looked at.  
Each country was different, depending 
on how services were led and funded.  
At different times there were different 
politics and benefits systems.  
This meant that services were often 
controlled and delivered differently.   
 
 
 
User experience  
The studies found that relationships 
between users of care services, staff 
and unpaid carers were very important.  
 
3 
 
 
This helped to make sure: 
• people got the services they needed, 
where they wanted them 
• they were being listened to about 
what they wanted 
• different parts of the system worked 
well together  
 
 
 
Some people did not have equal 
access to good services, particularly 
people with complex needs.  
 
 
 
Governance 
Governance is the rules about how an 
organisation works. 
These things should be part of 
governance systems:  
• a clear aim for all parts of care to 
work well together 
 
• laws that are supportive and clear 
 
• only make very important parts into 
law – leave other parts to be flexible 
for different areas and different 
needs 
4 
 
  
• be clear about roles and 
responsibilities and levels of funding 
 
• look at: 
 
o how people experience social 
care 
o how and where it is delivered 
o and how it meets what people 
need 
 
 
 
 
Funding 
Funding should look at: 
• all stakeholders agreeing the same 
aims 
 
• making sure organisations and 
processes work together 
 
• making sure needs are met in local 
areas 
 
 
 
Funding was often difficult because of:  
• different ways of paying for things 
 
• separate budgets 
 
• the ways money moves between 
different parts of the system 
5 
 
 
Marketisation in health and social care 
means a system driven by competition 
and profit. 
Marketisation:  
• gives care users more choice 
• makes healthcare fairer because 
people do not have to rely on one 
organisation 
• could improve quality of care 
because of competition between 
providers 
• means that care systems work 
together 
• tends to benefit people who can 
afford to pay for better services or 
more services 
 
 
Involving people who use health 
and social care services 
 
Health and social care staff say that 
working together with people who use 
services is the best way to make sure 
services are delivered well. 
This can take a lot of time especially 
when developing individual care plans.  
 
6 
 
 
It is important to have good 
safeguarding systems across all levels 
of staff and service providers to make 
sure people are safe from harm and  
treated in the right way across the care 
system.  
 
 
 
Cooperation and trust between different 
parts of the system and service 
providers was important.  
This included the sharing of resources 
and responsibilities to deliver quality 
services.  
This went beyond just health and social 
care integration and could include other 
sectors such as education and 
employment. 
 
 
 
Shared information and communication 
systems were seen as good ways to 
help integration work. 
They also made service quality and 
workforce development better. 
 
7 
 
 
Where people can safely get care is an 
important part of meeting their needs.  
Care at home services must be planned 
for as well as care in places like care 
homes. 
 
 
Workforce 
Staff should have: 
 
• chances to go to training and 
courses 
• good work conditions 
• a chance for staff across the social 
care workforce to work and deliver 
services at a local level to meet the 
needs of local people 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Population health outcomes 
Studies show: 
• that access to care is not equal. 
 
There are needs not being met across 
European countries, especially for 
people on the lowest incomes or people 
who live in poorer areas 
 
• costs that were more likely to affect 
the poorest and most vulnerable 
older people  
8 
 
 
 
It is difficult to say if integrated health 
and social care meant that there was 
lower demand for services elsewhere in 
health care. 
 
 
What this report does not tell us 
• it does not tell us what works, or give 
a detailed look at national social care 
systems from Nordic countries 
• it does not include children’s services 
• it does not look at community and 
local programmes of social care 
services 
• or about voluntary organisations 
involved in delivery of care services 
 
 
 
What does this mean for policy 
and research? 
There was not one single national way 
of providing social care services. 
There was no agreement on the best 
way to lead or fund arrangements.  
The evidence does show standards 
and ways of working that help or do not 
help to make a national social care 
service.  
9 
There was not much evidence that 
national social care systems in Nordic 
countries had been checked to see if 
they were working well.
