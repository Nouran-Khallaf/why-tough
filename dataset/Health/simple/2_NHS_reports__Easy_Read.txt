Justice social work 
 
 
 
 
 
Justice social work means services 
that check and look after offenders in 
the community. 
At the same time justice social work 
makes sure people are safe in the 
community. 
 
 
 
 
Staffing 
In 2020 there were more than 9 
hundred justice social workers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Staying away from court 
Someone who has been accused of 
breaking the law can be passed to a 
local social work team or other 
organisation instead of going to court. 
In 2019 this happened to nearly 2 
thousand people.

Criminal justice social work reports                  
From 2019 to 2020 there were more 
than 28 thousand criminal justice social 
work reports written.  
This is a bit less than from 2014 to 
2015. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Social work orders 
A community payback order is an 
alternative to being sent to prison. 
It usually means doing unpaid work in 
the community. 
The number of community payback 
orders went down from 2015 to 2018. 
In 2019 the number went up a bit to 
around 17 thousand. 
 
 
 
 
The numbers of drug treatment and 
testing orders went down to 5 hundred 
in 2019. 
This number is around the same as in 
2015 to 2016.
