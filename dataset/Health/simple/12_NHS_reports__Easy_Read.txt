Children’s Services:  What we want to happen. 
 
 
 
Children’s social work and social care 
services should be within the National 
Care Service. 
 
 
This will make sure: 
 
• Children and families who are at risk 
will get good, regular services. 
 
 
 
• Health, social work, and social care 
services will work better together. 
 
 
• It will be easier for people to move 
between services. 
 
 
 
• Services will be easier for people to 
get. 
 
 
• Services will be built around the 
child, family, or person who needs 
support.

• One organisation is in charge of: 
 
o how people get services 
 
o how people are assessed for 
what services they need 
 
 
 
 
o how services get money 
 
 
 
 
o who is responsible for services 
working well.   
 
 
 
 
 
• We will keep the links we have with 
Education and Early Learning and 
Childcare services and make sure 
we can work better together.
