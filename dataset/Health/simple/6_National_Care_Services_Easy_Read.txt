Experiences of social care in Scotland 
 
 
In the rest of this document, when we 
say ‘people’ we mean people who 
answered the questions about social 
care and being a carer in the 2021/22 
Health and Care Experience Survey’. 
6 out of every 10 people said their care 
and support services were either ‘good’ 
or ‘excellent’ in 2021/22.  
This is less than in 2019/20.  
 
 
 
The number of people who thought 
their care and support services were 
‘poor’ or ‘very poor’ went up. 
 
 
 
Less people said they are getting 
funding for their help and support from 
the council, NHS and other 
organisations. 
 
The number of people getting unpaid 
care went up. 
An unpaid carer is anyone who cares 
for a friend or family member who 
cannot cope without their support.

Less people said they had a choice 
about sorting out their care. 
More people said they did not have a 
choice at all. 
 
 
 
In 2021/22 people who felt they needed 
support but did not get it, were more 
likely to be: 
• not white 
• disabled 
• living in deprived areas 
• LGBO (lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
other) 
• unpaid carers 
 
A deprived area is one where people 
have more difficulties in different parts 
of their life.  
For example many of the people who 
live there do not have: 
• enough money 
• choices and chances 
• resources – there might not be as 
many public services

Unpaid carers 
More than half of unpaid carers said 
they got no support with caring. 
More than 1 in 20 people said they give 
35 or more hours of care a week in 
2021/22. 
This is a bit more than in 2019/20. 
Unpaid carers giving a lot of care were 
more likely to have support than those 
giving smaller amounts of care. 
Unpaid carers were most likely to be 
supporting: 
• parents
• grandparents
• their husband, wife or partner
Young people aged 17-24 were the 
group most likely to feel supported to 
keep caring.

More than half of young carers said that 
caring has made their health and 
wellbeing worse.
