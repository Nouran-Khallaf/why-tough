Adult social care in Scotland – information about 
equality  
 
 
People who: 
• get social care  
• are unpaid carers  
• are social care workers  
are a mix of different kinds of people.  
They have many different needs and 
experiences. 
 
 
 
 
In 2020, 3 out of every 4 people getting 
social care support and services in 
Scotland were aged 65 and older.  
3 out of every 5 people getting social 
care services were female.  
 
 
 
 
People of all ages get social care 
support. 
There are now more people of all ages 
getting adult social care services in 
Scotland.

Women are more likely than men to 
give regular unpaid care.  
An unpaid carer is anyone who cares 
for a friend or family member who 
cannot cope without their support. 
People of any age can be unpaid 
carers. 
 
 
 
1 in every 10 people aged between 16 
and 44 are carers. 
3 in every 10 people aged between 45 
and 64 are carers. 
2 in every 10 people over 64 years old 
are carers. 
 
 
 
In 2020 most adult social care staff 
were female.  
Social care workers are usually older 
than workers in other job areas.

There are not enough facts or 
information about the experiences of 
people from protected characteristic 
groups. 
You can find out more about protected 
characteristics in this Easy Read 
document. 
We need more information about 
people who have changed their gender, 
and on religion or belief. 
 
 
 
Some groups have been really 
challenged by the Coronavirus 
pandemic including:  
• older people 
• disabled people  
• people who were told to shield
